## [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=0s)

One of the cheapest ways to encode information in terms of 0s and 1s is using    voltage levels, illustrated in the diagram below.

> Digital Abstraction
> The method of determining *discrete* values out of analog voltage (which value is originally made up of real number, and therefore *continuous* and *infinite*) is called the **digital abstraction**.

This is how digital circuits work.  We need to find a **reliable framework** to determine **digital** signal values out of analog voltage values. This framework is called the [Static Discipline](#the-static-discipline).  

What are the benefits of the digital abstraction?
1.  The digital abstraction is where one interprets voltage values as **binary** values, thus allowing us to encode information using voltages.
2.  Using voltages to encode bits of 0's and 1's provides a **cheap and stable way** for us to exchange information through digital devices.
3.  We can also **manipulate** or **change** information encoded using voltages very easily.

The voltages that represent digital bits are generated by **semiconductor devices (MOSFET)** -- something that we will learn in the next chapter. The benefit of using semiconductors  the ease of generation, and that they require zero power in steady-state. The drawbacks however, is that the voltages generated by these semiconductors are easily affected by external disturbances,  and hence they may be unstable.

To preserve the integrity of information encoded in digital devices made of semiconductor materials, we need to **set some contracts between these interconnected digital devices**. In this notes, we are going to learn *how* we can use voltages to encode information in a stable way that follows a particular contract called the    **static discipline**  to guarantee the behaviour of each processing block in the system.


  
## [A Digital Processing Element: Combinational Device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=255s)


A digital device is any device that uses **voltages** to encode information in terms of “low voltage” **(bit 0)** and “high voltage” **(bit 1)**. 

A combinational digital device is a type of digital device where its output is a <span class="orange-bold">pure function</span> of the present input only *(there's no memory of past inputs)*. It is **stateless** and has the following criteria:
1. It requires one or more digital inputs
2. It produces One or more digital outputs
3. It has a **functional specification** that details the value of each output for each possible **combination** of inputs (can be illustrated in terms of truth table / boolean expression) 
4. It has a **timing specifications**: propagation delay and contamination delay (later) 

{:.note}
You have seen this in our previous chapter: the $$A>B$$ 2-bit comparator device is a **combinational device**, consisted of pure logic gates and behave like a <span class="orange-bold">pure function</span>. 

**Examples** include: logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, INV, etc), simple devices like multiplexers, demultiplexers. 
Later on you will learn another type of digital logic devices called the **sequential** logic device, whose output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the inputs, hence having a *memory*. 

### Combinational Digital System
A combinational digital system is a larger, more complex digital system made up **entirely** of combinational circuits.

It has the following criteria:
* **Each circuit element is also combinational with no directed cycles** (no *feedback* loop), and 
* That very device's input is connected to **exactly one output of another device** or to some vast supply of `0`s and `1`s.

Examples include: Arithmetic logic units (ALUs), Control Unit for CPU or memory address decoding.
  
## [Voltage to encode information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=438s)
Combinational devices operate based on **logical** functions, producing outputs determined solely by current inputs. The inputs and outputs of these devices are represented as binary values (0s and 1s). Binary values are not abstract—they are implemented using voltage levels in hardware.

{:.highlight}
Voltage is the **medium** used to encode binary information.

The most naive way to use voltage to encode information is to use ‘low’ voltage to encode valid ‘0’ and ‘high’ voltage to encode valid ‘1’, and define the low and high threshold for each valid ‘0’ and ‘1’.

Anything that is between the low and high threshold value is called the <span class="orange-bold">invalid zone</span> because it does not unambiguously represent a binary value. This is shown in the figure below:
  
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/6uo61vk9yze1aot/Volt.png?raw=1"  class="center_seventy"    >

{: .note}
The values of operating voltage in practice: e.g LVCMOS33 standard is commonly set to be **0.3V** for **low** voltage (binary value `0`) and **3.3V** for **high** voltage (binary value `1`). 

Combinational circuits like AND, OR, and NOT gates **rely** on these voltage representations to **interpret** inputs and produce outputs. This encoding **must** be robust enough to handle noise and imperfections in the physical world.

## [The Static Discipline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=634s)
The static discipline is one of the **contracts** bound for all logical elements making up a digital system.

  
{: .important-title}
> The Static Discipline
>
> The static discipline is a **framework** that establishes a **contract** between digital devices.
> 
> **The contract**: A digital system **must** be able to produce a valid output (for the next device connected at its output terminal) according to its specification **if** it is given a **valid** input.
>
> **Purpose**: It ensures that circuits are designed to **tolerate** variations (like noise) and still maintain **correct** logical behaviour.
>
> **Physical implementation**: 4 **voltage specifications** and **noise margins** to ensure **reliable** communication between digital devices. These standards define valid voltage ranges for "0" and "1", and not just single voltage points.

This contract **guarantees** the behaviour for each processing block in a system, so that a set of such interconnected devices may work properly (are able to pass and compute valid information at the end of the chain of connections). This is necessary so that the system has a **predictable behaviour.**

{: .highlight}
A combinational logic device **always** obeys the static discipline, as it **guarantees** that the outputs produced will meet the required voltage levels to be **correctly** interpreted by the next stage of the system, provided the inputs also meet their valid voltage ranges.

<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">However this doesn't mean that the opposite is true.</span>

A device receiving invalid input does <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> necessarily produce invalid output. The output from a combinational logic device given invalid input remains *unpredictable*. 

An unconnected terminal or a dangling wire in a digital circuit is <span class="orange-bold">not</span> considered a valid low digital signal. In digital electronics, each signal line or terminal must have a definite state: high (1), low (0), or sometimes a high-impedance state.

## [Voltage Specifications and Noise Margin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=488s)


### A case without noise margin
Consider two digital devices connected in series as shown in the figure below. These devices are called a **buffer**, meaning that they pass the same bit over (if it receives a low voltage, it will produce a low voltage and vice versa). If we were to *naively decide* that any voltage below $$V_{low}$$=`0.5V` as digital bit `0`, and any voltage above $$V_{high}$$=`2.5V` as digital bit `1`, then our device **may violate the static discipline.** 

**Why?**


<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/9lejkhiqx50ga8y/p4.png?raw=1"  class="center_fourty" >

Suppose we supply 0.5V and the first buffer is able to produce also 0.5V, which means digital bit`0` . 
* <span class="orange-bold">Problem</span>: A *wire*, that connects two or more combinational devices together is susceptible to **noise**. 
* The voltage value that is received at the second 2 may be *slightly higher* than 0.5V, for example: 0.55V instead, and therefore according to our specification, it is *no longer a valid bit `0`*.

{: .note}
Noise can knock the voltage down as well (not just up, it's basically random disturbance). The above is just an example that's affecting to the logical integrity of the devices in this example.

  
Buffer 1 in the figure would **violates** the *contract* because given a **valid** input, it may be **unable** to produce a valid output (to **reach** the next buffer 2), because the `0.5V` produced at the output of buffer 1 may meet some disturbances that caused it to be slightly off, e.g: `0.55V`.

### The 4 Voltage Specifications 

  

We <span class="orange-bold">need</span> to account for the presence of some light **noise**. Instead of naively setting some voltage $$V_{high}$$ and $$V_{low}$$ as we did above, we need to set a *range* of Voltages as valid bit `1` and `0` respectively. These ranges of valid voltages gives rise to **noise margin**, which purpose is to tolerate noise. 

{:.note-title}
> Definition
>
> There are 4 voltage specifications: Vol (V output low), Voh (V output high), Vil (V input low), and Vih (V input high) used as a framework to establish static discipline. 
> 
> It is <span class="orange-bold">important</span> that $$V_{ol}$$< $$V_{il}$$< $$V_{ih}$$ < $$V_{oh}$$. This way, output *amplifies*  the input via regeneration to ensure binary logic levels are maintained reliably across a digital circuit. See [appendix](#appendix) for further explanation. 
> 
> These 4 voltage specifications define the valid voltage ranges for inputs and outputs in a digital system to ensure reliable operation. They **define** what range of voltage values signifies a **valid** digital bit `1` and a **valid** digital bit `0` *for ALL combinational logic component in the system*.

$$V_{ol}$$ (voltage output low) and $$V_{oh}$$ (voltage output high) is the voltage that a digital device outputs.
*  A voltage value *less* than $$V_{ol}$$ is regarded as digital bit `0`
*  A voltage value *higher* than $$V_{oh}$$ is regarded as digital bit `1` 
*  The output of a digital system is going to be received by another system after traversing through some wire.

$$V_{il}$$ (voltage input low) or $$V_{ih}$$ (voltage input high) is the voltage that a digital device receives as **input** from digital system.
* A voltage value *less* than $$V_{il}$$ is regarded as digital bit `0`
* A voltage value *higher* than $$V_{ih}$$ is regarded as digital bit `1` 

To ensure static discipline, there must be a **gap** between the output and input specifications, forming the <span class="orange-bold">noise margins</span>. 

### Noise Margin

The noise margin illustrated as the yellow region in the Figure below. It *noise margin* adds as a **precaution** against external disturbances (noise). 

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/pt0n36pmy9ncyc6/Volt_2.png?raw=1"     >




The **absolute difference** between $$V_{ol}$$ and $$V_{il}$$ is called the **low bit noise margin**, and the **absolute difference** between $$V_{oh}$$ and $$V_{ih}$$ is called the **high bit noise margin**.

{: .note}
Low-bit/high-bit noise margin is formally defined as the **maximum** voltage amplitude of *extraneous* (erroneous) signal that can be added to the noise-free input level *without* causing a drastic change in the output voltage and that it is still within the valid logic level. 

### Noise Immunity
The **noise immunity** (like an "overall" or "effective" noise margin) is the ***minimum*** between the high bit noise margin and the low bit noise margin.


Note that the value of $$V_{ol}$$ is **less** than $$V_{il}$$, because we would want to have some *buffer* (margin) against noise. A device always outputs a lower voltage value to signify digital bit `0``0` and accepts a slightly higher low-voltage value as digital bit `0``0`. The same logic applies for the higher region as well, as $$V_{oh}$$ is greater than $$V_{ih}$$

In our previous case earlier, if $$V_{ol}$$ is set to be `0.5V`, and $$V_{il}$$ is set to be `0.6V`, then *Device 2*  will be able to **tolerate** up to `0.1V` of noise (if any). Therefore, `0.55V` in our example above is still '*seen*' as a valid bit `0` when it arrives at the input terminal of Device 2, thus making Device 1 ***obeys the static discipline.***


Once **set and chosen,** these four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ are to be obeyed by every digital **device in an entire combinational logic circuit**, e.g: your computer. Think of it like some sort of *operating standard* across all components in your digital system.

  

## [Voltage Transfer Characteristic Function (VTC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=974s)

The VTC is a **plot** between the input voltage ($$V_{in}$$) to a digital system/device vs the output voltage ($$V_{out}$$) of this digital system. It is used to come up with proper values for the 4 voltage specifications in practice, so that these values are well within the physical limitations of the digital device. 
* For example, if a device is unable to produce voltage value lower than 0.2V, then we should not set its Vol to be 0.1V

{: .warning}
VTC **does not** tell us how fast the device is. It just captures the static behaviour of the device and tells us what *kind* of device it is.

The image below shows the VTC of a **buffer**: a *low* $$V_{in}$$ gives a *low* $$V_{out}$$ and vice versa. 

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/vod5ltqh4kq9119/vtcbuffer.png?raw=1"   class="center_fifty"/>


{: .important}
Forbidden zone is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> equal to invalid zone. The latter is the zone where a voltage value does not correspond to digital bit `0` or `1` while the former is the zone whereby static discipline is violated because a valid input voltage does not produce a valid output voltage.

{: .new-title}
> Think!
> 
> What will the VTC of an inverter look like? 


The purpose of plotting a VTC (*typically obtained from device measurements, i.e: we supply input voltages at intervals and measure the output*) is to help us to **determine** whether or not a digital device **can be used** as a combinational logic device. In other words, we obtain the VTC so that we can find a set of four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ for the device so that **the device obeys the static discipline**.

Explanation of the VTC figure above:
- The red zone is called the **forbidden zone**. It is formed by the four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ that we set for the entire system. <br>
- The name *'forbidden zone'* comes from the fact that  any value within this zone means that the device receives **valid** input but is unable to produce a valid output hence **violating the static discipline** and cannot be used as a combinational logic device.

### Can a given device be used as a combinational logic device? 

You can quickly tell if a digital device can be *potentially* be used as a combinational logic device **iff**: you can **find** a set of these four voltage specifications: $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ **whereby its VTC curve  does not cross the forbidden zone** and that $$V_{ol}$$< $$V_{il}$$ < $$V_{ih}$$ < $$V_{oh}$$.
* We typically begin by *guessing* each value of $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ and check if the curve crosses the forbidden zone (check if static discipline obeyed) formed by these four values. 
* If static discipline is violated, we either adjust our guess or find another device. 
* Also, we want to choose  $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ that **maximises noise immunity**.

If you can satisfy the condition highlighted above, then it means that the device is a combinational logic device. Its VTC curve has to possesses both **characteristics** below:

1.  There exist *some region in the VTC* whereby its **absolute** `Gain` is $$>1$$ . `Gain` is actually a function of $$V_{in}$$ and is **formally** defined as: 

	$$\begin{aligned}
	\text{Gain}(V_{in}) = \frac{d V_{out}}{d V_{in}} \end{aligned}$$

	In layman terms you can approximate `Gain` during some transition $$V_{in_i}$$ to $$V_{in_j}$$ that results in some $$V_{out_k}$$ to $$V_{out_l}$$ respectively by the simply computing the slope between these two points on the VTC: 
	
	$$ \text{Gain} \approx \frac{V_{out_l}-V_{out_k}}{V_{in_j}-V_{in_i}}  $$

	If you have found four voltage specifications $$V_{ol}$$, $$V_{oh}$$, $$V_{il}$$, and $$V_{ih}$$ for which the device still obeys the static discipline, you can **approximate** device's maximum `Gain` by computing: 

	$$\max\text{Gain}\approx \frac{V_{oh} - V_{ol}}{ V_{ih} - V_{il}}$$


	If  absolute `Gain` $$>1$$, then there is a **finite, positive** noise margin. If absolute `Gain`$$=1$$, then there's **zero** noise margin. It is *impossible* to have absolute `Gain` $$<1$$ and still have the four Voltage specifications $$V_{ol}$$ < $$V_{il}$$ < $$V_{ih}$$ < $$V_{oh}$$.
	   Also, having absolute `Gain > 1` **maintains** integrity of the signal passed through the system as signal loss is inevitable in the real world.

2. The device has a  **Non-linear `Gain`**, meaning that `Gain`  is a **function** of `Vin` and therefore the *gradient* along the *entire* curve varies. 
	* The VTC curve for a combinational logic device should not be **entirely** made of a single, constant gradient like the shape of a plot from a basic line equation, but rather more towards an "S" (or mirrored S) shape.


{: .important}
If both characteristics above aren't satisfied in the VTC curve, then it is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> the VTC of a combinational logic device.

## [Summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVIr8jrtX0&t=1290s)
[You may want to watch the post lecture videos here.](https://youtu.be/3OoeuqWDhns)

Here are the key points from this notes:
1. **Static Discipline**:  An important **contract** (via setting the four voltage specifications), to ensure that the output of a digital component behaves correctly given specific valid input levels. This contract governs **all** digital devices in a system (not just a single gate!)
2.  **Noise Margin** and **Noise Immunity**: We need to take into account the presence of *noise* when we establish the voltage specification contract, so that we can still obey the static discipline despite the presence of noise.
3.  **VTC Graph**: A plot describing the behaviour (Vout vs Vin) of a digital device. This is very useful to determine reasonable voltage specifications that obey the static discipline. We need to **ensure** that the graph does <span class="orange-bold">not</span> cross the forbidden zone.

Smaller logic gates can be assembled to form more complex units and ultimately entire computer systems. We can be confident that the computer system will work predictably by ensuring that each sub-component obey the static discipline. This layered approach not only simplifies the design and development of digital devices but also ensures that even small components adhere to <span class="orange-bold">necessary</span> <span class="orange-bold">standards</span> to function correctly within the larger system.

## Next Steps 

In the next chapter, we will learn about the **MOSFET** (transistor), that is one of the smallest component (building block) that makes up a digital device, and how we can use them to form a proper combinational logic elements we call **gates**. These **gates** can be  used to form an even larger **combinational circuits** such as the **adder**, **shifter**, etc, and an even larger one such as the **Arithmetic Logic Unit** (you will build them in Lab 2 and 3). 

Each larger device will provide greater level of *abstraction*:
* At first we have MOSFETs (transistors) that we can use to make **logic gates**. Once we are using logic gates, we **abstract** away the details about our transistors.
* We can then use logic gates to make more complex logic units like ROMs, microcontrollers, multiplexers, registers, and CPU. Realise that once we have a CPU, we **abstract** away the details about our little logic gates. 
* Once we have a CPU, we can create an assembler to help us program an operating system in assembly. We can create more useful programs like compilers to help us create programs easily in higher level language. This is how abstraction works: we create smaller components and use them together so that we can do our job (as programmers) easily. 

Therefore, it is imperative that each  combinational logic device / component, no matter how small, **must** conform to the static discipline and the established four voltage specifications (that must be chosen such that it fits with their VTC) so that the larger system can work as intended. 

## Appendix

In digital systems, the term **"output amplifies input"** refers to the **restoration** or **regeneration** of signal levels by digital gates or devices to maintain distinct and reliable binary states. 

### Maintain signal integrity across stages

As signals propagate through circuits, they experience degradation due to resistive losses (voltage drops in wires), capacitive effects (slower transitions), and noise accumulation (fluctuations from the environment). Without amplification, these effects accumulate, causing the signal to drift into the invalid zone or become indistinguishable. A gain greater than 1 ensures that outputs regenerate the input to valid logic levels (Vol or Voh), restoring signal integrity for subsequent stages.

---

### How Output Amplifies Input
In digital logic gates, the transfer function ensures that small changes in input voltages near Vil or Vih result in **large** changes in output voltages, driving them to **valid** levels Vol for `0` or Voh for `1`. A <span class="orange-bold">steep</span> transfer function slope (gain > 1) allows the output to "snap" to valid states, effectively **amplifying** and **stabilizing** the input signal.



### Without Amplification (Gain ≤ 1)
If the gain is 1, the input-output relationship becomes linear, propagating noise directly without restoring valid levels. For gain < 1, signals **weaken** further, violating voltage specifications (Vol < Vil < Vih < Voh) and causing signals to **degrade** beyond recovery, making the system **unreliable**.


In short, amplification restores signal levels to ensure valid logic outputs, counteracting signal loss caused by noise and degradation. It enforces static discipline, guaranteeing that valid inputs produce valid outputs, and prevents cascading errors by regenerating distinct binary levels across multiple circuit stages.

{:.highlight}
The amplification is not "amplification" in the analog sense (where signals are continuously increased), but rather the regeneration of signals to ensure binary logic levels are maintained reliably across a digital circuit. Without this, digital systems would quickly fail due to noise and signal loss.
