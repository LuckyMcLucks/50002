## [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=0s)

In this chapter, we are learning a particular component called the **MOSFET** that can be used as a <span class="orange-bold">building block</span> to make combinational logic devices (logic gates and more complex digital systems). CMOS is ideal for combinational devices (that need to obey static discipline) because it provides output voltages that fully span from the supply voltage (Vdd) to ground (Vss), ensuring **clear** and **reliable** logic levels.

> Why MOSFET? 
> 
> If we connect MOSFETs in a specific way, we can **create** a combinational logic device that represents our desired *truth table* or *functional **logic** specification*. MOSFETs are used because they can produce reliable logic levels with low power consumption, are cost-effective, and generate minimal heat.

Further supporting characteristics of MOSFET:
* **High Noise Margins**: Ensures clear distinction between logical 0 and 1, reducing errors.
* **Low Static Power Consumption**: Prevents excessive heating and power waste in stable states.
* **Strong Drive Capability**: Can reliably drive subsequent stages without signal degradation.

{:.new-title}
> RECALL: before we continue
>
> The ideal behaviours and characteristics of a **combinational logic device** are:
> 1.  The device should be able to **tolerate** some amount of errors due to its *Noise Margins.* The Noise Margin exists if its VTC gain $$>1$$.
> 2.  If we have **high gain**, that means we can have **more noise margin**. *Take some time to convince yourself that this is true.*
> 3.  The device should be cheap, and small sized. *We do not want to have bulky devices, do we?*
> 4.  The device should have **zero power dissipation** when input voltages aren't changing. That's why the device must have a nonlinear gain.
> 5.  Otherwise when voltage is changing from, `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`, then power within the device has to dissipate **easily**, meaning that the change is swift, reliable, and quick. *We always want our computers to be fast, don't we?*
> 6.  The device has to be **functional**, meaning that it conforms to the assigned **truth table** (**logic**) at all times. *We do not want unpredictable "buggy" behaviour with our devices.*


## [The MOSFET Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=180s)

*Metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors* (MOSFET, or shortened as FETs) is the main material that is used to make our combinational device. The basic schematic of a transistor is shown in the figure below. 

{: .highlight}
MOSFETS are **four** terminal voltage-controlled **switches**. You can buy them at a relatively cheap price [online](https://www.mouser.sg/c/semiconductors/discrete-semiconductors/transistors/mosfets/?transistor%20polarity=P-Channel) for DIY projects. However in computer parts, they are the same components miniaturized to the nanometer scale for high-density integration.

Notable parts of  MOSFET and its function:

  1.  MOSFETs are electronic components that control whether a circuit outputs a high (1) or low (0) voltage, forming the **basic building blocks** of digital devices.
  2.  It has 4 terminals: drain, gate, source, and bulk. Input voltage is supplied at the **gate**, and output voltage is obtained at the **drain**.
  3.  Current flow between source and drain $$I_{DS}$$ is proportional to $$\frac{W}{L}$$ (the width and the length) of the MOSFET.
  4.  Source and drain is physically **symmetrical**, we name them depending on the type of the MOSFET and the direction of current flow. 
  5.  Depending on the input voltage supplied at the **gate**, a MOSFET can be either ON, allowing current to flow from source to drain, or OFF, leaving the drain with a floating or undefined value.

{:.note}
> Remember from your Physics classes:
> * Current flows from higher potential (+) to lower potential (-)
> * Electron flows from lower potential (-) to higher potential (+)

Current flows between the *diffusion terminals* (**source** and **drain**) if the voltage on the **gate** terminal is large enough to create a conducting channel (in pink) and the mosfet is on. Otherwise, the conducting channel does not form and the mosfet is off: the diffusion terminals are not connected.
* A MOSFET is said to function as a **switch** by using the **gate** voltage to control the formation of a conducting channel between the source and drain.
  * **Simplified idea**: You can connect load (e.g: LED) + power source at the source, and ground at the drain 
  * Then supply input at the gate to "connect" the source and the drain terminal to turn on the LED
* When the channel forms, current flows (ON state); otherwise, the source and drain are disconnected (OFF state).


MOSFETs are arranged in **[complementary](#complementary-mos-circuitry)** pairs (PFET and NFET) <span class="orange-bold">to form logic gates</span>, where their ON/OFF states control the output voltage. For example, in an AND gate, the transistors are configured so the output is high only when all inputs are high, while in an OR gate, the output is high if any input is high.

Before we learn more about the complementary arrangement of PFETs and NFETs for logic gates, itâ€™s essential to first understand how each type operates individually.

## [Types of MOSFETs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=275s)


<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/qd1zhsulqjmknv2/pfetnfet.png?raw=1"  class="center_fifty"    >


There are two types of FETs: **NFET** and **PFET** as shown above.

1.  **NFET** : the majority of the charge carrier for the **bulk** are *holes* (p-type semiconductor). The majority of the charge carrier for the **source and drain** are electrons (n-type semiconductor). Typically, the bulk is connected to GND to keep the PN junction *reverse biased*.
2.  **PFET** : the majority of the charge carrier for the **bulk** are electrons (n-type semiconductor). The majority of the charge carrier for the **source and drain** are holes (p-type semiconductor). Typically, the bulk is connected to `VDD` to keep the PN junction *reverse biased*

The circuit symbol for NFET and PFET are shown as above. Note that the **bulk** of NFET is connected to `GND`, and the **bulk** of PFET is connected to `VDD`, and it is often *implied* and omitted in circuit diagrams.


{: .note}
Please watch the [supplementary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJxBlO5NMGs&list=PLklpDKpv-EBhCVUAZDDRWEGZzR_It-FSo&index=3) or refer to the [later](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/cmostechnology#appendix) section if you are unclear about what is a PN junction, p-type, or n-type semiconductors.


Some important terms we need to know:
1.  `VDD` : voltage source
2.  $$V_{TH}$$: threshold voltage.
3.  `GND` : ground
4.  *Reverse-biased:* a state whereby D is insulated from S, where current cannot flow from D to S **in the presence of applied voltage**.
5.  A FET that is  "ON" refers to a state whereby  there exists a connection between D and S, so that current can flow through them.
6.  A FET that is "OFF" refers to a state whereby there is no connection between D and S. Current cannot flow through them.



## Switching NFETs and PFETs ON/OFF

See the figure below and its corresponding explanation to understand better how NFET and PFET operates. The two drawings on top are PFETS (left: OFF and right: ON). The two drawings below are NFETS (left: OFF and right: ON). You might want to refer to this Figure as well when reading the **[appendix](#p-type-and-n-type-semiconductors)** below.

###  [How NFET operates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=819s)

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/7oevad7tcpr2ob4/nfet_t.png?raw=1" class="center_fifty"  >	  

1.  **Connections**:
	- Bulk is connected to `GND` to keep the PN junction reverse biased, meaning that no current should flow or leak between source and bulk and between drain and bulk.
	- S (and also bulk) is connected to `GND` for NFET. Current from D is therefore *drained* to `GND` connected to S.
2.  It is "**ON**" when $$V_{GS} = V_G - V_S$$ is **high** enough. Since source terminal is connected to the `GND` for NFET, 
	- $$V_{GS} = V_G - 0 = V_G$$, 
	- the NFET is \"ON\" whenever $$V_G$$ is high enough, i.e: $$> V_{TH}$$.
	- When $$V_G > V_{TH}$$, it draws the electrons towards the gate. An n-channel (made of electrons) will be formed between source and drain.
	- Note that $$V_{TH}$$ for NFET is *positive*.
3.  When it is \"ON\", current can pass from D to S.
	- Electron, its **majority** charge carrier flows from S to D
		> We can say that its majority charge carrier is **drained** at D
	- The output of an NFET is at the D terminal.
	- Hence, the output of an \"ON\" N-type is `0`
4.  It is \"OFF\" when $$V_{GS}$$ is **low**, as it encourages depletion region to form further.

The figure below summarizes how NFET works as a "switch" that connects the load with the power source and ground:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Hardware/images/cs-2025-NFET.drawio.png"  class="center_seventy"/>


###  [How PFET operates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=960s)

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/u7nuy6cayaik0q7/pfet_t.png?raw=1"  class="center_fifty" >	  

1.  The PFET symbol is similar to NFET except that it has the by the  bubble $$\circ$$. Conversely for its **connections**: 
	- Bulk is connected to `VDD` to keep the PN junction reverse biased, meaning that no current should flow or leak between source and bulk and between drain and bulk.
	- S (and also bulk) is connected to `VDD` for PFET. Current can flow from S to D.
2.  It is "ON" when $$V_{GS}$$ is **low** enough. Since source terminal is connected to `VDD` for PFET, 
	  - $$V_{GS} = V_G - VDD$$, 
	  - Hence effectively PFET is \"ON\" whenever $$V_G - VDD$$ is low enough, i.e: $$< V_{TH}$$. 
	  - When $$V_G < `VDD` + V_{TH}$$ (or equivalently, $$V_{GS} < V_{TH}$$), it draws the holes towards the gate. A p-channel (made of holes) will be formed between source and drain.
	  - Note that $$V_{TH}$$ for PFET is *negative*.
3.  When it is \"ON\", current can pass from S to D.
	- Hole, its **majority** charge carrier flows from S to D. 
		> We can say that its majority charge carrier is **drained** at D (same as NFE)
	- The output of an PFET is also at the D terminal.
	- Hence, the output of an \"ON\" p-type is `1`
4.  It is "OFF" when $$V_{GS}$$ is **high**, as it encourages depletion region to form further.


The figure below summarizes how PFET works as a "switch" that connects the load with the power source and ground:

> Summary
> 
> MOSFETs operates using **voltages**. No current flows from the gate towards source/drain since the gate is insulated from source and drain. This is unlike common (cheaper) PNP and NPN transistor (standard bipolar junction transistor -- BJT) that operates using current. The "output" that we get at the drain of either PFET or NFET is a result of the connection between Source and Drain due to the presence / absence of voltage in the gate.  


## [Complementary MOS circuitry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=1185s)

### The Pull-up and Pull-down Circuit in CMOS


To form a fully **functional combinational logic device** that implements a particular functionality or **logic**, these PFETs and NFETs  can be connected together to form a **CMOS** circuit (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor). 

There are two parts of CMOS: **the pull-up circuit** and **the pull-down circuit**. Its *general schematic* is shown in the figure below:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/ywble3yr4bxj99z/cmos.png?raw=1"   class="center_fifty"   >


Contents of the pull-up circuit:

  1.  All FETs in the pull-up circuit are PFETs.
  2. Hence all of their bulks are connected to the `VDD`, and so are all of their Sources.
  3. It is called 'pull-up' because when there is any  connection from the Source (`VDD`) to the Drain output, then the output of the overall CMOS circuit is 1.
  4. **We call the pull-up circuit to be ON if there exists any direct path for *current* to flow from any source of the PFETs in the pull-up circuit to the logic output drain.** 

  
Contents of the pull-down circuit:
 1.  All FETs in the pull-down circuit are NFETS.
 2.  Hence all of their bulks are connected to `GND`, and so are all of their Sources.
1.  It is called 'pull-down' because when there is  connection to from the Source (`GND`) to the Drain output, then the output of the overall CMOS circuit is 0
2.  **We call the pull-down circuit to be ON if there exists any direct path for *electrons* to flow from any source of the NFETs in the pull-down circuit to the logic output drain.** 


## [The CMOS Complementary Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=1388s)

Imagine if pull-up and pull-down circuit (as an overall) are both "ON". This means that there exists a direct  connection to `GND` from the `VDD` (the source of the pull-up to the source of the pull-down) resulting in **short-circuit**. 

Hence, **it is very important for a CMOS circuit to contain  complementary pull-ups and pull-downs**. This means that only one component -- either pull-up or pull-down -- is **ON**. 

The main building blocks of the CMOS complements is summarized as below:


<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/y9o0f8qba2ura21/cmoscomp.png?raw=1"      >

{: .note}  
A combinational logic circuit can be made by connecting two NFETs in **series** as a pull-down circuit, and two PFETs in **parallel** as a pull-up circuit. 


For example, the following is a CMOS circuitry for a NAND gate: 

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/pfkmo27rmgiklbo/nand.png?raw=1"    class="center_fourty">
  

There are two inputs to this circuit, called A and B. A low or high voltage representing bit `0` or bit `1` respectively can be supplied to both input terminals. From the diagram, A is connected to the PFET on the **left** and the NFET on the **top**. B is connected to the PFET on the **right** and the NFET on the **bottom**. 

Now we consider several cases. In Case 1, we consider what the output will be when `A=1` and `B=1`. In Case 2, we consider what the output will be when `A=0` and `B=1`. There are actually four cases, as shown on the truth table in the figure, but we will only discuss two here as we can easily extend the logic for the remaining cases.

**Case 1:**
-  Lets see what happens when `A=1` and `B=1` (both at high voltages that represent bit 1)
-  When `A=1`, the PFET on the **left** is "OFF", the NFET on the **top** is "ON"
-  When `B=1`, the PFET on the **right** is "OFF" and the NFET on the **bottom** is "ON"
-  Current from `VDD` **cannot** flow to the output through any of the left and the right PFET
-  Current at the output **is drained down to the `GND`** through both NFET on the top or NFET on the bottom.
-  Hence the output of the device is `0` when `A=1` and `B=1`

  

**Case 2:**
- Another case, when `A=0`, and `B=1` (A at low voltage that represent bit `0`, and B at high voltage that represent bit `1`)
- When `A=0`, the PFET on the **left** is "ON", the NFET on the **top** is "OFF"
- When `B=1`, the PFET on the **right** is "OFF" and the NFET on the bottom is "ON". 
- This means there's *no connection* between the output and the ground. However, current from `VDD` can still flow from the PFET on the **left** to the output. 
- Hence the output of the device is `1` when `A=0` and `B=1`

  

Notice how there's parallel PFET in the pull-up, and series NFET in the pull-down. This is exactly the **recipe** for **CMOS complement**, ensuring that there will be no combination of input that will cause both pull-up and pull-down circuits to be **ON**. 

{:.important}
As practice, you can try to trace what happens when `A=0, B=0`, and when `A=1,  B=0` and construct a truth table for this simple circuit. 

## [Logic Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=1860s)


Notice how the circuitry in the previous section is called **NAND**. The name comes from this particular **functional specification** (truth table) of the combinational logic circuit. 


{: .highlight}
A combinational device with multiple inputs but **only one output** is called a **logic gate** .

The NAND gate is just one of many possible gates that we will encounter in this course. We can make various logic gates: **NAND**, **NOR**, **INV**, **XOR**, etc using PFETs and NFETs and connecting them in a complementary way in order for them to work and produce the boolean logic as intended. The schematic of a XOR gate and an XNOR gate is as follows:

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/lab2/2.png"  class=" center_fourty"/>

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/lab2/3.png"  class=" center_fourty"/>


We will <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> test you on designing transistor-level circuitry, but you should be able to a given CMOS circuit and derive the truth table from it. 

As an exercise, write down the truth table of the following CMOS circuitry:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab2/mhp-cmos.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

  

## Timing Specifications of Combinational Logic Devices

{:.note}
Propagation Delay and Contamination Delay are critical timing **metrics** in digital circuits. These delays exist due to the physical and electrical properties of the circuit components and are crucial for ensuring reliable operation.


Combinational devices must be documented with proper timing specifications that specify the upper bound (**propagation** delay) required to compute the specified output given a set of valid and stable input values, and the lower bound (**contamination** delay) before the output may begin to change after a change in the inputs.

### [Propagation Delay $$t_{pd}$$](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=1900s)

{: .important-title}
> Propagation Delay
> 
> Assume the output of a device is initially invalid. The propagation delay, denoted as $$t_{pd}$$ is defined as the time taken for the device to produce a **valid** output, measured the moment it was given a **valid** input. **It determines the maximum speed at which a circuit can operate**.

To find the propagation delay of a circuit schematic, follow these steps:

1. **Identify All Paths**: List all possible paths from any input to any output.
2. **Calculate Delay for Each Path**: For each path, sum the propagation delays of all the gates along that path.
3. **Determine the Longest Path**: Identify the path with the <span class="orange-bold">highest</span> total delay, known as the critical path.
4. **Total Propagation Delay**: The propagation delay of the circuit is the delay of the critical path.

{:.note-title}
> Critical Path
>
> The critical path in a digital circuit is the **longest** path from <span class="orange-bold">any</span> input to <span class="orange-bold">any</span> output, which determines the maximum propagation delay of the circuit. 
> 
> It is the path that takes the **most** time for a signal to travel through the circuit, and it defines the overall speed at which the circuit can operate, as the circuit cannot produce a valid output (all bits) until all signals have propagated through this path.


The propagation delay is determined by the longest path because it dictates the maximum time the circuit takes to **stabilize** its output after an input change.
- **Sequential dependency**: Each component (gates, made up of FETS in CMOS arrangements) in the combinational logic circuit must wait for one another to produce a valid overall output.
- **Overall output validity**: All components must produce valid results before final **output** (the last logic gate in the circuit) can be produced.

{:.important}
For a device with more than one output bit, all output bits must be valid simultaneously for the device to function correctly. This means that the propagation delay of the device is determined by the longest delay among all the output paths, ensuring all outputs are stable and valid at the same time.
  

### [Contamination delay $$t_{cd}$$](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=1950s)


Another timing specification that is typically measured an indicated on a combinational logic device is the contamination delay.

{: .important-title}
> Contamination Delay
>
> Assume the output of a device is initially valid. The contamination delay  denoted as $$t_{cd}$$ is defined as time taken for the device to produce an **invalid** output when it was initially valid, measured  from the moment it was given an **invalid** input. This ensures that signals **stabilize** before propagating to the next stage in a circuit.

To find the contamination delay of a circuit schematic, follow these steps:

1. **Identify All Paths**: List all possible paths from any input to any output.
2. **Calculate Delay for Each Path**: For each path, sum the contamination delays (minimum delays) of all the gates along that path.
3. **Determine the Shortest Path**: Identify the path with the <span class="orange-bold">lowest</span> total contamination delay.
4. **Total Contamination Delay**: The contamination delay of the circuit is the delay of the shortest path.

{:.note-title}
> Shortest Path
>
> The shortest path in the context of contamination delay is the path through the circuit that has the **minimum** total delay from an input to an output. 
> 
> This path defines the contamination delay because it represents the **fastest** possible route for a signal to propagate through the circuit, indicating the **earliest** time at which any output may change (such as become invalid from previously being valid) in response to a change at the input.

The intuition behind why t$$_{cd}$$ is calculated as the minimum cumulative contamination delay over all paths:
- **Fastest propagation of errors**: errors take the fastest route to propagate *invalid* signal and finally,
- **Earliest contamination**: errors *contaminate ANY output* (to be invalid, when it was initially valid) via this shortest path


{:.important}
For contamination delay, it is enough for just one output bit to become invalid for the entire device to be considered invalid. The contamination delay indicates how **long** the circuit can hold  its **previous valid output** (all bits) before any invalid input starts to affect the output, representing the minimum time the circuit can maintain its state before any bit becomes invalid.


## [Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqgZcV_1IU4&t=2087s)


Complementary pull-up (made up of PFETs) and pull-down circuits (made up of NFETs) form a CMOS gate. With these gates, we can form a combinational logic circuit, example as shown:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/nhxsimty73njphx/example.png?raw=1" class="center_fifty"      >

Given the $$t_{pd}$$ and $$t_{cd}$$ for the NAND gate: $$t_{pd} = 4 ns$$, $$t_{cd}=1ns$$, we can find that:
- The overall $$t_{pd}$$ of the circuit is $$12 ns$$ (the path in red)
- The overall $$t_{cd}$$ of the circuit is $$2 ns$$ (the path in blue)

 
## Summary
[You may want to watch the post lecture videos here.](https://youtu.be/cJxBlO5NMGs)

Here are the key points from this notes

1. **MOSFETs Basics**: NFETs and PFETs are both MOSFETs, they behave like switches. NFETs are activated by applying **high** voltage at the gate, and will produce **low** voltage at its drain. PFETs are activated by applying **low** voltage at the gate, thus producing **high** voltage at its drain. 
2. **Complementary MOS**: The use of complementary pairs of NFETs and PFETs are crucial to form stable and efficient logic gates. A parallel NFET circuit must have a complementary series PFET counterpart, and vice versa. 
3. **Logic Gates**: We were introduced with CMOS schematic of basic logic gates like NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. We also must be able **trace** the functionality of a given CMOS circuit. 
4. **Timing Specifications**: Propagation delay (tpd)  and contamination delay (tcd) exist due to the physical and electrical properties of combinational logic devices. To compute tpd, find the **critical path** through the circuit. To compute tcd, find the **fastest path** through the circuit. 


{: .note}
Knowing how long the combinational device takes to react (at most) tells us how *often* (e.g: at what rate) can we supply  new inputs to the device, and how fast the device can process/compute a *batch* of input values. 

We can assemble a few FETs to implement any truth table or Boolean functions (we will learn this more in next chapter), hence creating combinational logic devices. A specific type of combinational logic devices that has one output bit is called as **gate**. There are many types of gates, depending on the Boolean function that's realised. Then, an even larger combinational logic circuits (that realises more complicated Boolean functions) can be created by assembling many of these gates together. We will learn how to build more complex circuits in the next few chapters.


# Appendix

Please refer to this section if you are interested to learn more about p-type and n-type semiconductors, PN junction, and source-drain terminal naming.

  
### P-type and N-type Semiconductors

{: .important}
**Not to be confused with PFET and NFET.**

In the **p-type** semiconductor there are plenty of **acceptor atoms** and in the **n-type** semiconductor there are plenty of **extra electrons (donor atoms)**. We can say that a p-type region is where the majority of the carriers are holes and an n-type region is where the majority of the carriers are electrons. 

To be precise, an electron is one of the *constituents* of an atom, having a negative charge. An **acceptor** atom has for example 3 electrons in *valence shell* and can **accept** one electron to complete the covalent bonding. Thus it gains one extra electron and acquires **negative charge**. On the other hand, a donor atom has 5 electrons (one extra) in valence shell and can donate one extra electron. It thus acquires unit positive charge in the process.

  

### Depletion Region

When p-type and n-type semiconductors are placed together, the free electrons from n-type will **flow over (diffuse)** to the p-type and fill its holes (impurities). Filling up a hole results in a negatively charged ion at the p-type semiconductor, as illustrated as the *gray
circles* in Figure above. Equally, these free electrons leaving the n-type leaves behind a **positively charged ion** at the n-type semiconductor. This is illustrated as the yellow circles. 

Eventually, a space-charge builds up forming an **electric field** as denoted in the left drawings (the yellow circles and the grey circles form electric field), *preventing* more free electrons from the n-type side to the p-type side, thereby forming an insulating layer called **depletion region**.

  

### P-channel or N-channel Formation

For NFETs, when there's presence of high (positive) voltage at the gate, it repels the extra holes at the p-type bulk. Basically, a positive voltage applied to the gate attracts electrons (which are minority in the p-type substrate) to the interface between the gate dielectric and the two n-types semiconductors (drain and source). 

These electrons form a conducting **n-type channel** between the source and the drain, called the **inversion layer**. When there's *potential difference* between the drain and the source, the current will flow from drain to source through this inversion layer. 

For PFETs the opposite happens. When there's presence of low (negative) voltage at the gate, it repels the extra electrons at the n-type bulk. Basically, holes (which are minority in the n-type substrate) are the majority in the region between the gate dielectric and the two p-types semiconductors, forming a conducting **p-type channel** (inversion layer). When there's potential difference between drain and source, then the current will flow from source to drain through this inversion layer.

The position of the source and drain in PFET is switched , compared to what is depicted for NFET. Read the next section for details.

  

### Naming of Source and Drain  

The naming of the Source and Drain terminal depends on the **majority** of the charge carrier. The **majority** charge carrier is always meant to be **drained** at D and **sourced** at S, meaning that it flows from S to D.

In PFETs, current flows from Source to Drain, because the majority of the charge carrier is holes (positively charged). In NFETs, current flows from Drain to Source, because the majority of the charge carrier is electrons (negatively charged).

{: .note}
Current (`I`) **cannot flow out back to the Gate** because there's a capacitor there (**infinite** resistance). The function of the gate capacitor is to create electric field enough to pull either electrons up to the gate in NFETS or holes up to gate in PFETs to create a conductive n-type (electrons) or p-type(holes) channel.

### Reverse Bias in PN Junction

The bulk of the PFET is connected to the `VDD` while the bulk of the NFET is connected to the `GND`. We do this to keep the PN junction in each FET to stay in the *reverse biased* state by default, until they're switched **on**.  A simple explanation on why we need to keep them in reverse biased state by default is so that it encourages the presence of the depletion region hence preventing major *current leaks* across the junction when the FET is **off**. You may watch [this](https://youtu.be/cJxBlO5NMGs?t=295) video that we made if you'd like to know more about reverse biasness (and other stuffs like the PN junction diode, and P/N type semiconductors), but these details are out of our syllabus.
