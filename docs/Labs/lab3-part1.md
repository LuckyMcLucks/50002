# Lab 3: Arithmetic Logic Unit
{: .no_toc}

{: .warning}
Before this lab, you are required to [complete this very basic FPGA tutorial](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/fpga/fpga_1) we wrote and perhaps the official [Getting-Started-With-FPGA tutorial](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/lucid_v1/your-first-fpga-project/) by Alchitry lab. Please **come prepared** and bring your FPGA + laptops where Vivado + Alchitry Lab is installed. At least one person in each team should have a laptop that can run Vivado and bring the FPGA. 


## Starter Code
Please clone the starter code from this repository, then **open** it with Alchitry Lab. 
```
git clone https://github.com/natalieagus/alu-starter.git
```

{: .important}
Since there's only 1 FPGA per group, you need to work through this lab as a 1D group during class. However each person must still submit the lab questionnaire **individually**.

You are <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">not required</span> to submit your code for this lab. You will need it anyway for your 1D Project Checkoff 1: ALU and you should submit it then. Simply head to eDimension and do the lab questionnaire by the stipulated due date. 

## Related Class Materials
The lecture notes on [Logic Synthesis](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/logicsynthesis) and [Designing an Instruction Set](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/notes/instructionset) are closely related to this lab.

The lab will reinforce your understanding on how you can build the circuit to conform to the logic that you want, e.g: adder circuit will perform binary addition of input A and B, etc, and make it **programmable** using the control signal: `ALUFN`. 

{: .warning}
You are <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> allowed to use **any** of Lucid's **math** and **comparison** operators when implementing this lab's ALU 13 functionalities. This is the requirement of your 1D project because we would like you to learn the basics and not solely rely on Vivado's capability on creating components of the ALU. Please follow the implementation of the units from the given schematics. **Failure to comply will result in -2% of your overall grades**. However, you can use them for array indexing or checking conditions in loops. 

## Part 1 Introduction 

In this lab, we will build a 32-bit **arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)** for the Beta processor. You <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">will</span> need this for your 1D Project Checkoff 1 **and** Lab 4 (Building the Beta). 

{: .new-title}
> Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
> 
> The ALU is a **combinational** logic device that has two **32-bit inputs** (which we will call “A” and “B”) and produces one **35-bit output**: `alu[31:0]`, `Z`, `V`, and `N`. 
> We will start by designing the ALU modularly. It is composed from five as a separate modules, each producing its own 32-bit output. 
> We will then combine these outputs into a single ALU result.

In this lab (both Part 1 and 2), we will attempt to create a 32-bit ALU. It is one of the components inside our Beta CPU. We will eventually utilise our work here to build an entire Beta CPU circuit in the next lab (Lab 4). 

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) serves as the central core of the CPU, handling a variety of logical computations. Essential operations that a standard ALU encompasses are:
* An **Addition/Subtraction** Unit, facilitating elementary addition and subtraction tasks.
* A **Comparison** Unit, utilized for branching functions.
* A **Boolean** Unit, dedicated to boolean operations such as XOR, bit masking, and similar tasks.
* A **Shifter** Unit, instrumental in operations like division or multiplication by 2, as well as segmenting data.
* A **Multiplier** Unit, specialized in performing multiplication. The design of this unit is more complicated than the rest of the units. We will do this in Part 2 of the Lab, alongside assembling the complete 32-bit ALU. 

{: .important-title}
> Important: <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">ALUFN</span> != <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">OPCODE</span>
> 
> 
> The `ALUFN` signal is **NOT** Beta CPU `OPCODE`, despite both being 6-bit long. These two encodings are **NOT** the same.
> The `ALUFN` is used to **control** the operation of the ALU circuitry, while the Beta CPU `OPCODE` is used by the Control Unit to **control** the entire Beta CPU datapath. In Lab 4, you will build a ROM as part of the Control Unit that will translate the `OPCODE` field of a currently executed instruction into the appropriate `ALUFN` control signal. 


## Task 1: Adder and Subtractor Unit
Implement an **adder/subtractor** unit that can add or subtract 32-bit two’s complement (**SIGNED**) inputs (`A[31:0]`, `B[31:0]`). It should generate a 35-bit output: (`S[31:0]`) **and**`Z`, `V`, `N` signals.  `A[31:0]` and `B[31:0]` are the 32-bit two’s complement (SIGNED) **input** operands and `S[31:0]` is the 32-bit signed **output**. `Z/V/N` are the three **other output** code bits described below: 
* `Z` which is true when the S outputs are all zero (i.e., `NOR(S) == 1 ? Z = 1 : Z = 0`)
* `V` which is true when the addition operation overflows (i.e., the result is too large to be represented in 32 bits), and 
* `N` which is true when the S is negative (i.e., `S31 == 1 ? N = 1 : N = 0`). 

`Z, V, N` will later be used by the **comparator** unit (read next section). The following diagram illustrates a suggested implementation of the 32-bit Adder/Subtractor Unit using a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-COMPACT-ADDER.drawio.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

The `ALUFN0` input signal controls whether the operation is an `ADD` or `SUBTRACT`.  `ALUFN0` will be set to `0` for an `ADD (S = A + B)` and `1` for a `SUBTRACT (S = A – B)`. To perform a `SUBTRACT`, the circuit first computes the two’s complement of the `B` operand before adding the resulting value with `A`. The two's complement of `B` is computed using the XOR gate and `ALUFN0` as carry in to the first Full Adder in the RCA. 


### Computing Overflow: `V`
Note that **overflow** can never occur when the two operands to the addition have **different** signs. If the two operands have the same sign, then overflow can be detected if the sign of the result differs from the **sign** of the operands. Note that we use `XB`, **not** `B`.

$$\begin{align*}
V = &A_{31} \cdot XB_{31} \cdot \overline{S_{31}} + \overline{A_{31}} \cdot \overline{XB_{31}} \cdot S_{31}
\end{align*}$$

{: .new-title}
> Think!
> 
> Why is `V` computed like the above? Start by having a small example, let's say a 4-bit RCA. If we have `A: 0111`, and `B: 0001`, adding both values will result in a **positive overflow**. The true answer to this should be decimal `8`. With signed devices, we need **5** bits to represent decimal 8: `01000`. However since our RCA can only output 4-bits, we have our output as just `1000`, and this means decimal -8 in a **signed** 4-bit output. Now think about other possible overflow cases (negative overflow, etc).


### Detailed Adder/Subtractor Schematic
Here’s the detailed schematic of the adder to get you started:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-ADDER.drawio.png"  class="center_full"/>

You may start by making a 1-bit **Full Adder** module first, and **then** create a 32-bit RCA module. Afterwards, assemble everything inside `adder.luc`. 

### Implementation Tips 

{: .warning}
Remember that you are **NOT** allowed to use Lucid's math operator, such as `out = a+b` or `out = a-b` to implement the adder unit. Please follow the implementation of the schematic above. This is part of the requirements of your 1D project. You can however use these operators for **indexing**.

**for-loops**

You can utilise `for` loops in Lucid (the same applies for Verilog) to **duplicate** creation of multiple units of `fa`. For instance, if you have the following `fa` module interface:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-FA.drawio.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

```cpp
// fa.luc 
module fa (
    input a,
    input b,
    input ci,
    output co,
    output s
  )(
    // implementation
    
  )
```



You can utilise it as follows to create a 32-bit Ripple Carry Adder module's body:

```cpp
// rca.luc
module rca (
    input a[32],
    input b[32],
    input ci,
    output s[32]
  ) {
  fa fa[32];
  var i;

  always {

    // set the inputs to the first unit (LSB) of the RCA 
    fa.a[0] = a[0];
    fa.b[0] = b[0];
    fa.ci[0] = ci;
    
    for (i=1; i<SIZE; i++){ // define the connections for the other 31 units of fa 
      fa.a[i] = a[i];
      fa.b[i] = b[i];
      fa.ci[i] = fa.co[i-1];
    }
      
    s = fa.s; // connect the output bits
  }
}
```

{: .warning}
Remember that **for-loops** in HDL (Hardware Design Language) like Lucid or Verilog does **not** perform the same way like the `for` loops we are familiar with in Python or Java. It's important to understand that in HDLs, for-loops are used to **describe hardware**, <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">not</span> to control flow as in software programming. They primarily for **generating repetitive hardware structures**.

**Reduction Operators**

In HDLs, **reduction** operators applies the logic across the bits of the input to produce a single bit output. For instance, given `a = 4b1010`:
* `|a` (reduction OR) is `1|0|1|0`, which is `1`
* `&a` (reduction AND) is `1&0&1&01` which is `0`
* `^a` (reduction XOR) is `1^0^1^0` which is `0`

### Test 

Once you have implemented `adder.luc`, **connect** its input and output properly in `alu.luc` so that we can test our adder unit **manually**.

```cpp 
// alu.luc body
    adder.a = a;
    adder.b = b;
    adder.alufn_signal = alufn_signal;

    z = adder.z;
    v = adder.v;
    n = adder.n;

    out = adder.out; 
```

Afterwards, **compile** the project and **test** them using the dip switches and observe the output at `io_led`. We have written a **simple** test connection for you. You can press `io_button[0]` to capture the current dip switches state as the value of `a`, `io_button[1]` as the value of `b`, and `io_button[2]` as the value of `alufn`. The "captured" value will be whatever the state of the dip switches is during the press. 

Since `a` and `b` are 32-bit long and we only have 24 dip switches, we took a shortcut and encode the following:

```cpp
  // store a 
  a.d = c{io_dip[2], 8b0, io_dip[1], io_dip[0]}; // set io_dip[2] to dictate MSB 8 bits
```

As for `alufn` signal, we use `io_dip[0][5:0]` (the rightmost 6 switches). 

Think of **useful test cases**, such as addition of zeroes, addition of two negative numbers, test overflow, subtraction of -ve values, and so on. 

{: .important}
Please **utilise the switches carefully**, they're **delicate** and easy to break. Use the tip of a male jumper wire to flick them. 

### Further Note 
We made it a requirement in your 1D project to **NOT** use Lucid (or Verilog) math and comparison operators when implementing any of the 13 functionalities of the ALU. You can technically implement a 32-bit adder unit in this manner and let Vivado do the work: 

```cpp
module adder (
    input a[32],
    input b[32],
    input alufn0,
    output s[32]
  ) {

  always {
    if (alufn0){
      s = a + b;
    }
    else{
      s = a - b;
    }
  }
}
```

However the above does not allow you to learn anything new. Implementing components of the ALU from scratch has its own benefits as you're still learning. 

Firstly, it enables you to gain a deeper insight into the underlying hardware mechanisms that perform arithmetic operations, and offers a tangible perspective on how abstract mathematical concepts are translated into physical, operational circuits. 

This hands-on experience is invaluable for developing an appreciation of the intricacies and challenges associated with digital circuit design, including considerations of **timing**, **power consumption**, and **scalability**.

Secondly, it encourages problem-solving skills, requiring you to apply logic and reasoning to create efficient and functional circuits, along with the first few weeks of 50.002 materials. This process enhances your ability to design, troubleshoot, and optimize digital systems, skills that are crucial for both academic and professional success in the CS field.

Finally, it cultivates an **appreciation** for the evolution of digital design methodologies and the role of automation in modern engineering. You are *not* learning *how to rely* on Vivado but rather to figure out how it works under the hood.


## Task 2: Compare Unit
Implement a 32-bit compare unit that generate 1 bit output, depending on the following conditions: 
<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/lab3/7.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

The inputs to the compare unit are:
1. The `ALUFN` control signals (used to select the comparison to be performed), in particular: `ALUFN[2:1]`
2. The `Z`, `V`, and `N` bits. They're the output of the adder/subtractor unit. The adder **must** be in **subtraction** mode. 

{: .new-title}
> Think! 
>
> Why should the adder be in subtraction mode? 


### Performance
The `Z`, `V` and `N` inputs to this circuit can only be produced by the adder/subtractor unit. That means we need to first perform a 32-bit addition/subtraction between `a` and `b` before we can compare them. This means there's some significant **tpd** to produce the output of the compare unit as the RCA is considerably **slow**. 

In real life, you can speed things up considerably by thinking about the *relative* timing of `Z`, `V` and `N` and then designing your logic to minimize delay paths involving late-arriving signals. For instance, if you need to perform computations involving `Z` and other variables, you can compute those intermediary output involving the other variables first while "waiting" for `Z`. We do not need to worry much about it in this Lab as Vivado will do all sorts of optimisation for you. 

#### Detailed Compare Unit Schematic
Here’s the detailed schematic of the compare unit. Pay **close** attention to the bit selector and the corresponding inputs at the mux:

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-COMPARE.drawio.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

### Implementation Tips 
Since you are **not** allowed to use Lucid's math and comparison operators to implement this lab, it will be beneficial for you if you create a `mux_4` unit first: 

```cpp
// mux_4.luc
module mux_4 (
    input s0,  // selectors
    input s1,
    input in[4], // inputs 
    output out
  ) {

  always {
    case (c{s1, s0}){
      b00: out = in[0];
      b01: out = in[1];
      b10: out = in[2];
      b11: out = in[3];
      default:
        out = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

You can then utilise this inside `compare.luc` to implement the compare truth table above. 

### Test 

Test your compare unit manually **before** proceeding to the next section. 
1. Edit `alu.luc` and make all the necessary connection between the `adder` and the `compare` unit, 
2. Supply the `Z, V, N` inputs to the `compare` unit appropriately,
3. Set `adder.alufn_signal = 1` as the adder **must be subtracting** in order for the `Z, V, N` signal to be usable by the compare unit

You should connect the `out` signal of `alu.luc` to the output of the `compare` unit instead of the `adder` unit **for now**. 

Since the alu **must** produce a 32-bit output, you should **set** the higher 31 bits to `0`, and set the LSB to the output of the **compare** unit as follows:

```cpp
// alu.luc body 
  out = c{31x{b0}, compare.cmp}; // concatenation 
```

Again, your test cases **must be comprehensive**, and think of possible **edge** cases such as comparing two negative numbers together, or comparing zeroes. 

{: .important}
It is very important to test each of your modules **incrementally** before proceeding to the next section. Debugging HDL is <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">extremely difficult</span> (no straightforward and convenient `print` statements or debugger to "pause" execution), so we shall minimise propagation of errors by testing each small module carefully. 

## Task 3: Boolean Unit

Implement a **32-bit Boolean unit** that performs **bitwise** boolean operation between `a` and `b`. The unit should receive 32-bits of `a` and `b` as inputs, as well as 4-bit `ALUFN[3:0]` input, and **produce** a 32-bit output. In particular it should perform either `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, or `A` bitwise boolean operations, depending on the `ALUFN` signals supplied: 

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/lab3/10.png"  class="center_twenty_five"/>

#### Detailed Boolean Unit Schematic
Here's the general schematic of the Boolean Unit:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-BOOL.drawio.png"  class="center_fourty"/>

**Explanation**:

One possible implementation of a 32-bit boolean unit uses **32 copies of a 4-to-1 multiplexer** where `ALUFN0`, `ALUFN1`, `ALUFN2`, and `ALUFN3` **hardcode** the operation to be performed, and `Ai` and `Bi` are hooked to the multiplexer **`SELECT`** inputs.  This implementation can produce any of the 16 2-input Boolean functions; but we will only be using 4 of the possibilities: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `A`. 

In total, you should utilise 32 4-to-1 multiplexers to build the boolean unit. You can utilise the earlier created `mux_4.luc` module to implement this. 

### Implementation Tips 

You will need 32 copies of `ALUFN` signals as you will be plugging them into the input ports of each `mux_4`. To do this, you can use the **duplication** operator in lucid, for instance:

```cpp
// boolean.luc 
  // module declaration 

  // declaration of modules utilised in boolean unit 
  mux_4 mux_4_32[32];
{% raw %}
  always{
    // create 32 copies of ALUFN signal as input to each mux_4 unit 
    // the double curly brackets are intentional because
    // we are creating 2D array: 32 by 4 bits
    mux_4_32.in = 32x{{alufn_signal[3:0]}}; 
    // the rest of boolean.luc body 

  }
{% endraw %}
```


### Test 
Please test the `boolean.luc` module by making appropriate connections in `alu.luc` before proceeding. For now, connect the output of the boolean unit to the output of the alu unit, as follows:

```cpp 
// alu.luc body

  boolean.a = a;
  boolean.b = b;
  boolean.alufn_signal = alufn_signal;

  out = boolean.bool 
```

Don't forget to think of **useful test cases** that test not only the functionality of each boolean operation, but also **edge cases** (e.g: `A` and `B` are all `0` or `1`).

## Task 4: Shifter
Implement a **32-bit shifter** unit that is able to perform a shift left (SHL), shift right (SRA), or shift right arithmetic (SRA) operation on `A`:
* The `A[31:0]` input supplies the data to be shifted  
* The **low-order** 5 bits of the `B[4:0]`  are used as the **shift count** (i.e., from 0 to 31 bits of shift)
* We do not use the high 27 bits of the `B` input (meaning that `B[31:5]` is **ignored** in this unit)

For example, if `A: 0x0000 00F0` and we would like to **shift** A to the left by FOUR bits, the `B` input should be `0x0000 0004` 

The desired operation will be encoded on `ALUFN[1:0]` as follows:

<img src="/50002/assets/contentimage/lab3/12.png"  class="center_fifty"/>

With this encoding, the **control** signal `ALUFN0` controls whether we are performing a **left shift** or a **right shift** (SHR). `ALUFN1` decides whether we apply the **sign extension** logic on **right shift**.   
* For `SHL` and `SHR`, `0`s are shifted into the vacated bit positions.  
* For `SRA` (“shift right arithmetic”), the vacated bit positions are all filled with `A31`, the sign bit of the original data so that the result will be the same as arithmetically dividing the original data by the appropriate power of 2.

#### Detailed Shifter Unit Schematic
The simplest implementation is to build **three** separate shifters: one for shifting **left**, one for shifting **right**, and one for shifting **right arithmetic**. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-SHIFTER.drawio.png"  class="center_full"/>

Notice how a **multi-bit shift** can be **accomplished** by **cascading** shifts by various powers of 2.  
* For example, a 13-bit shift can be implemented by a shift of 8, followed by a shift of 4, followed by a shift of 1. 
* Each shifter unit is just a cascade of multiplexers each controlled by one bit of the shift count.  

Afterwards, we can use a 4-way 32-bit multiplexer to select the appropriate answer as the unit’s output.  

{: .new-title}
> Alternative Approach: Compact Shifter
> 
> Another approach that **adds** latency but **saves** gates is to use the *left shift logic* for **both** left and right shifts, but for right shifts, **reverse** the bits of the `A` input first on the way in and **reverse** the bits of the output on the way out.
>
> Here's the schematic of this compact shifter.
>
> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/lab3-fpga/2024-50002-COMPACT-SHIFTER.drawio.png"  class="center_full"/>

### Implementation Tips 

You might want to create a `mux_2.luc` module here to help your implementation:

```cpp
module mux_2 (
    input s0,
    input in[2], // note: you can put input as an array, or declare them separately, e.g: input d0, input d1
    // it will affect how you utilise this mux
    output out
  ) {

  always {
    case (s0) {
      0: out = in[0];
      1: out = in[1];
      default:
        out = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

Then, you might want to implement `x_bit_left_shifter.luc` unit, where x is a variable value. You can supply a parameter to a module that can be "instantiated" during declaration time. 

```cpp
module x_bit_left_shifter #(
  // parameter declaration, to be set during module instantiation
  // default value given is 8
  SHIFT = 8 : SHIFT > -1 & SHIFT < 32
  )(
    input a[32],
    input shift,
    input pad,
    output out[32]
  ) {
  
  // module declarations
  // declare your mux_2 (32 of them)
  // other useful variables, e.g: shifted_bits[32] 
  
  always {
    // assign value to shifted_bits[32] depending on the value of SHIFT
    // connect the selector of each mux_2 with shift 
    // 
    // use a for-loop to: 
    // connect input[0] of each mux_2 with a[i]
    // connect input[1] of each mux_2 with the shiftedbits[i]xs
  }
}
```

{: .warning-title}
> Warning: Instance Connections
> 
> Be cautious when connecting inputs and parameters using **instance connections**. They are **duplicated** across modules. 
>
> For example: `pipeline pipe [8] (#DEPTH(16));` instantiate 8 pipe modules, each with `DEPTH = 16`. As of now, we have not find a direct way to set different `DEPTH` parameter values for each `pipe` (in verilog, we can do this with `generate`). 
> 
> Here's what the documentation say: _You can also specify an array size for the instance. If you do this, that module will be duplicated in your design for each element in the array. Any connections or parameters specified at instantiation will be connected to each instance separately. For example, if your module has a single-bit input `clk` and you connect a signal to it, that single-bit signal will be **duplicated** and **connected** to **each** module._
>
> However, this behaviour is <span style="color:#ff791a; font-weight: bold;">not observed</span> in `dff` (**special type**). You can do: `dff ctr [32] (#INIT(32d15), .clk(clk));` and `ctr[0]` will take the least significant bit of `32d15` as `INIT`, which is `1`, and `ctr[31]` will take the most significant bit of `32d15` as its `INIT`, which is `0`. 

### Performance

The shifter unit is made by cascading various multiplexers together to shift `A` in **stages**. Suppose you know the `tpd` of each mux_2, could you compute the tpd of the shifter unit output? 

> Of course it depends on your design and which shift operation is done (e.g: SHR vs SRA). Compute the `tpd` for each design (regular vs compact shifter) and shift operation.

### Test 
Please test the `shifter.luc` module by making appropriate connections in `alu.luc` before proceeding. For now, connect the output of the shifter unit to the output of the alu unit, as follows:

```cpp 
// alu.luc body

  shifter.a = a;
  shifter.b = b[4:0];
  shifter.alufn_signal = alufn_signal;

  out = shifter.shift;
```

Please be **mindful** when testing this unit, it should be as comprehensive as the tests you've done for the other 3 units above. 

## Summary 

You are free to implement each module in whichever way you deep fit, or even come up with a new schematic as long as you don't use Lucid's math operators and compare operators to implement any of these 13 functionalities. You can however use them for indexing purposes or conditional loops. 

Remember to **always** test each module separately. 

In the next lab, we will implement the multiplier module and attempt to assemble each module together to form a complete 32-bit ALU unit.

When you're done with the implementation of these 4 modules, head to eDimension to complete this week's lab quiz.
