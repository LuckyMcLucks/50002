# Lab 4: Beta Processor with FPGA (Self Guided Practice)
{: .no_toc}

This is a self-guided practice post Lab 4. You can read this handout at your own time to supplement your knowledge about I/O Handling, specifically focusing on the sequence of **interrupt handling**, transitioning to kernel mode, executing **privileged** operations, and returning to **user** mode using a simple assembly code example.

Here we also learn how to connect I/O units to the CPU using **shared-memory** I/O:
1. Reading from input buffer
2. Display certain memory content to output buffer and refresh it at a constant rate 


## Beta Assembly Source Code
We have written a simple 28-line that demonstrates a minimal kernel behavior. You can copy and paste this to `instruction_rom.luc` to learn how shared-memory I/O works. You need to manually ensure that the outputs are correct by observing each **state** of the Beta (PC content, Regfile content, control signals, etc) at each instruction execution. It is recommended that you write an automatic tester like you did for your ALU in Checkoff 1, but manual checks will do for a small scale project like your 1D project.

The instruction is as follows. Notice that the first instruction (address `0`) is placed at the **bottom** of the arrow to follow Verilog/Lucid array convention.

```verilog
   // Driver code, BR(reset) is the first instruction
  const INSTRUCTIONS = {
    32h6FE50000, // 0x06C JMP(R5)
    32hC0BF000C, // 0x068 ADDC(R31, 12, R5) --- reset handler, go to main in user mode 
    32h6FE50000, // 0x064 JMP(R5)
    32hC0BF000C, // 0x060 ADDC(R31, 12, R5) 
    32h649F000C, // 0x05C ST(R4, 0xC, R31) 
    32hC09F0001, // 0x058 ADDC(R31, 1, R4)
    32h649F000C, // 0x054 ST(R4, 0xC, R31) 
    32hC09F0002, // 0x050 ADDC(R31, 2, R4)
    32h649F000C, // 0x04C ST(R4, 0xC, R31) 
    32hC09F0003, // 0x048 ADDC(R31, 3, R4)
    32h649F000C, // 0x044 ST(R4, 0xC, R31) 
    32hC09F0004, // 0x040 ADDC(R31, 4, R4)
    32h649F000C, // 0x03C ST(R4, 0xC, R31) --- countdown 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 to be be displayed at beta_output
    32hC09F0005, // 0x038 ADDC(R31, 5, R4) --- illop handler, show generic countdown
    32h6FE50000, // 0x034 JMP(R5) --- execute main
    32hC0BF000C, // 0x030 ADDC(R31, 12, R5)  
    32h649F000C, // 0x02C ST(R4, 0xC, R31) --- store to output_buffer: Mem[12] to display the input
    32h609F0010, // 0x028 LD(R31, 16, R4) --- irq handler, load value from input_buffer: Mem[16]
    32h00000100, // 0x024 LONG(256) --- trigger illop when R3's value is eventually 0 after several loops to main_sub
    32h7BE3FFFB, // 0x020 BNE(R3, main_sub, R31) 
    32h607F0020, // 0x01C LD(R31, 32, R3) 
    32h643F0020, // 0x018 ST(R1, 32, R31)
    32h90410800, // 0x014 CMPEQ(R1, R1, R2) 
    32hC4210001, // 0x010 SUBC(R1, 1, R1) --- main_sub
    32hC03F0003, // 0x00C ADDC(R31, 3, R1) --- main
    32h77FF0007, // 0x008 BR(irq)
    32h77FF000C, // 0x004 BR(illop)
    32h77FF0019  // 0x000 BR(reset)
  };
```

Here's the equivalent instruction that can be run on bsim:

```nasm
.include beta.uasm

|| This code will not work as-is in bsim because in beta lucid we separate data memory and instruction memory
|| Edit the value of message and test_value below to run it in bsim

message = 0xC || replace to 0xCC for bsim, 0xC for lucid

```

{: .note}
We do not actually instantiate a memory unit with 32-bit addressing. Hence we do not physically separate Kernel program vs User program for this lab (demonstration purposes only). In reality, kernel program resides in the memory region with address MSB of `1`, and user program resides in the memory region with address MSB of `0`. To prevent User Program `main` from executing the `irq` handler that's placed right after it, we design the `main` to end with a constant `LONG(256)` which will **officially** trigger an `ILLOP` situation.


## Operating the Beta
It should be fairly easy for you to know what the tester program do. We have three handlers in address `0, 4, and 8` respectively to handle what has to be done in the event of `reset`, `illop`, and `irq`. The actual implementation of the handlers reside in label `reset`, `illo`, and `irq` respectively. 
1. When you have implemented the `beta_cpu` succesfully and compiled it, ensure that ALL switches are down. 
2. Load the compiled binary to the FPGA. At this point, your PC is pointing to `Mem[0x0]`. Use `io_dup[0]` to inspect the states of the Beta CPU. 
3. Press the `next` button: `io_button[4]` (right button) to execute the next instruction. 
4. Refer to `README.md` inside the repository for more information on how to operate the Beta CPU automatically.

### Debug Signals
As a reminder, `io_dip[0]` can be changed to "view" various states presented at `io_led[1]` and `io_led[0]` (16 bits of values at once). Simply set it to represent the values below, e.g: `0x3` means that `io_dip[0]` is set to `00000011` (turn the rightmost two switches on). Here are the exhaustive list:

1. `0x0`: MSB 16 bits of current instruction (id[31:16])
2. `0x1`: LSB 16 bits of current instruction (id[15:0])
3. `0x2`: LSB 16 bits of instruction address (ia[15:0])
4. `0x3`: LSB 16 bits of EA (this is also ALU output) (ma[15:0])
5. `0x4`: MSB 16 bits of EA (this is also ALU output) (ma[31:16])
6. `0x5`: LSB 16 bits of Mem[EA] (mrd[15:0])
7. `0x6`: MSB 16 bits of Mem[EA] (mrd[31:16])
8. `0x7`: LSB 16 bits of RD2 (mwd[15:0])
9. `0x8`: MSB 16 bits of RD2 (mwd[31:16])
10. `0x9`: LSB 16 bits of pcsel_out
11. `0xA`: LSB 16 bits of asel_out
12. `0xB`: LSB 16 bits of bsel_out
13. `0xC`: LSB 16 bits of wdsel_out
14. `0xD`: MSB 16 bits of instruction address. Useful to see PC31 (kernel/user mode) (ia[31:16])
15. `0xE`: LSB 16 bits of beta input buffer. This is a dff that's hardwired to reflect Mem[0x10]
16. `0xF`: LSB 16 bits of beta output buffer. This is a dff that's hardwired to reflect Mem[0xC]

We have also provided all this information in the repository's [readme](https://github.com/natalieagus/beta-fpga-starter). 

### The `slowclk`

{: .important}
The entire system runs on FPGA `clk`. However we need some other signal to **slow down** specifically the Beta CPU `PC` advancement so that we can **observe** the CPU's states like `id`,`ia`, `ma`, `mrd`, `mwd`, output of all muxes (pcsel mux, asel mux, bsel mux, and wdsel mux), as well as the value of I/O buffers. As such, we need <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">additional logics</span> to prevent the `PC` from advancing too fast.  

The Beta expects an input called `slowclk` so that you can slowly **observe** its execution (either by pressing `io_button[4]` or when `slowclock_edge` or `fastclock_edge` fires). The `slowclock_edge` turns `1` roughly once (for a single FPGA clock cycle) every 1.3s, and `fastclock_edge` is roughly 4 times faster than `slowclock_edge`. You can use `io_dip[2][6]` to enable/disable `fastclock`.

{: .important}
It is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">necessary</span> for `slowclock` and/or `fastclock` period to be at least <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">5 times longer</span> than Alchitry Au FPGA's because of how `fsm motherboard` is designed in `au_top.luc` (see next section). That is, the minimum index of `frequency_divider` in `au_top.luc` that can be used for `slowclock` and/or `fastclock` is `2` (index `0` is LSB).

Right now in `au_top.luc`, we are using index `27` and `25` so that you have sufficient time to observe its output:

```verilog
    // driving the beta 
    slowclock_edge.in = frequency_divider.value[27];
    fastclock_edge.in = frequency_divider.value[25];
```

## User I/O
The system is designed to have the following input and output unit for user interaction:
- **Input**: `io_button[2:0]` triggers interrupt (hardwired). This is the up, middle, and down button. 
- **Output**: set `io_dip[0]` to: `00001111` (`0x0F`) and the output will be displayed at the 7seg. This is your "screen".

When `io_button[0]`, `io_button[1]`, or `io_button[2]` is pressed, we write some logic in `au_top.luc` to store its encoding to `system_input_buffer` and `system_output_buffer` (32 bit dff) defined in `motherboard.luc`.  

```verilog
    // in au_top.luc

    // connect hardware interrupt button 
    interrupt_button_conditioner.in = io_button[2:0];
    interrupt_button_edge.in = interrupt_button_conditioner.out;
    motherboard.irq = interrupt_button_edge.out; // IRQ as long as any of of the buttons[2:0] is pressed

    ...

    // display the content of output_buffer
    h0F: // LSB 16 bits of system_output_buffer 
      io_led[1:0] = {motherboard.output_buffer[15:8], motherboard.output_buffer[7:0]};
      seg.values = {motherboard.output_buffer[15:12], motherboard.output_buffer[11:8], motherboard.output_buffer[7:4],motherboard.output_buffer[3:0]}; 
```

```verilog
    // in motherboard.luc

    // store the button press to input buffer 
    if (|irq){
      if (irq[0]){
            system_input_buffer.d = 32hB0;
      }
      else if (irq[1]){
            system_input_buffer.d = 32hB1;
      }
      else if (irq[2]){
            system_input_buffer.d = 32hB2;
      }
    }
```

These buffers are then synchronized to a specific region in `memory_unit` so that your Beta CPU can access its values. 

### Shared_memory I/O

This is a Shared Memory with Direct Memory Access design. This is different from [Memory-Mapped I/O](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/memory-mapped-vs-isolated-io) design or Isolated-Mapped (also known as port-mapped) IO. 
> In MMIO, the CPU accesses the hardware registers of the network card directly, using standard memory instructions (LD/ST). A memory controller / arbiter directs the CPU to the hardware buffer or the RAM depending on the address requested. The **mapped** address points to the device, not to RAM. In Isolated IO, the CPU communicates with the network card using special I/O instructions (e.g., IN and OUT on x86). These instructions **explicitly** access the device's registers through a separate I/O address space (not memory).

In this shared memory design, our I/O device controllers have direct access to the memory unit (hence the name Direct Memory Access or DMA) I/O buffers (`system_input_buffer` and `system_output_buffer`). Since the memory unit is also used by the CPU, we need to implement some kind of arbitration mechanism. In practice, a **memory controller** (part of the CPU or chipset) is responsible for managing access to **shared** memory. The memory controller ensures that the memory unit (RAM) reflects these updates immediately, so the CPU sees the latest input data when it accesses specific regions of the RAM.

{: .note}
We choose `memory_unit` address `0x10` as the region to hold the last-received input value, and we choose `memory_unit` address `0xC` as the region to hold the current output value. 

The memory controller must facilitate data transfer into address `Mem[0x10]` to reflect the contents of `system_input_buffer`, and update `system_output_buffer` to reflect the content of address `Mem[0xC]`. 

If we were to `STORE` any value to `Mem[0xC]`, it will be reflected at the "output" of the motherboard (simplified), e.g the 7 segment. We have simple hardware controller that continuously read from `system_output_buffer` and updates the LED display. Similarly, if any input button `io_button[2:0]` is pressed, it will trigger an <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">INTERRUPT</span>, and the CPU can find the **encoding** of the currently pressed button ready at `Mem[0x10]`. When interrupt occurs, `Mem[0x10` would've been synced to reflect the content of `system_input_buffer` by the controller. 
 
The memory controller is implemented as part of the motherboard in this simple project.


## The Motherboard
In practice, a motherboard is the main printed circuit board in general-purpose computers. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial components of a system: the CPU, the memory unit, and provides **connectors** for peripheral (I/O) devices.

The module `motherboard.luc` is where we instantiate our major hardware components:
1. The Beta CPU 
2. The memory unit (both data and instruction)
3. System input and output buffer (`32` bits each). This serves as a buffer that holds current input or current output value. The motherboard is connected to actual buttons (input) and LEDs (output) in `au_top.luc`.
4. The instruction ROM (for initial loading of instruction)

We define their connections and added a simple FSM called `motherboard` that <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">runs the Beta</span> and arbitrates memory access (shared between CPU and I/O buffers). 

### `LOAD`
Upon start up, `LOAD` instructions from instruction rom to the instruction memory part of the memory unit. We do not use the ROM directly to simulate a more realistic approach whereby upon boot up, we will load our data from **disk**  (signified by this ROM) to our physical memory. 

### `RUN` 
Once all instructions are loaded, we go to the `RUN` state. In the `RUN` state, we mostly "idle" and wait for the next `slowclk` to fire (advance the PC). When `slowclk == 1`, we need to deliberately do two things: refresh output and input buffers.

### `LOAD_OUTPUT` and `DISPLAY_OUTPUT`
Firstly, to **refresh** our `system_output_buffer`. This is done by **two states**: `LOAD_OUTPUT` and `DISPLAY_OUTPUT` because our `simple_dual_ram` requires 1 FPGA clock cycle to be able to display the requested data at a given read address. 

### `UPDATE_INPUT`
Secondly, to **refresh** `Mem[0x10]` (so that it matches the content of `system_input_buffer`). This is done by a single state: `UPDATE_INPUT`. Afterwards, the motherboard goes back to the `RUN` state, until `slowclk` turns 1 again and the whole output and input update is done. 

### `slowclk` period

The content at `Mem[0x10]` will only reflect `system_input_buffer` until after we exit `UPDATE_INPUT` and enters the `RUN` state again. The **soonest** any other component can read the updated `Mem[0x10]` is **two** clock cycles from `UPDATE_INPUT` (`UPDATE_INPUT` --> `RUN` --> `RUN`). Hence if the current instruction involves `LD` from `Mem[0x10]`, we need to make sure **at least** two `RUN` states happen after we exit from `UPDATE_INPUT` before `slowclk` fires. We <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">also</span> need at least three FPGA `clk` cycles have passed to account for `RUN` --> `LOAD_OUTPUT` --> `DISPLAY_OUTPUT` --> `UPDATE_INPUT`. In total, `slowclk` period must be at least **five times** longer than the FPGA `clk` period.


### Storing to `REGFILE`
While waiting for the `slowclk`, our Beta has received `id` and `mrd` (whenever applicable). It is also continuously supplying all output to the `memory_unit`: `ia`, `wr`, `ma`, and `mwd`. In other words, it **continuously** execute the same instruction over and over for the duration of the period of `slowclk`. To avoid having <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">repercussions</span> we need to take care of the `werf` signal in the `regfile_unit`. 

It should **NOT** continuously write to `regfile_unit`. Notice this line in `regfile_unit.luc`:

```verilog
    // do not write anything to the regfile unless PC advances 
    regfile.write_enable = 0;
    if (slowclk) {
      regfile.write_enable = werf;
    }
```

The purpose of this line is to avoid instructions that read from and write to the <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">same register</span> e.g: `ADDC(R0, 1, R0)` to not be executed many times for the duration of the `slowclock` period. Remember that <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">all our sequential logic devices still run on</span> `clk`, which is the actual FPGA clock signal. We simply add additional logic in the `pc_unit.luc` so that we *advance* our instruction when `slowclk` fires. Suppose for each period of `slowclk`, 200 FPGA `clk` cycles has passed. If we do not set `regfile.write_enable = 0`, we are effectivelly running the instruction `ADDC(R0, 1, R0)` for 200 times (instead of once!) and we will have the value 200 inside `R0` instead of `1` as per the instruction. 

{: .warning-title}
> Warning
> 
> For most instruction, it is okay to **repeatedly** execute that instruction many times, once per `clk` cycle while waiting for the next `slowclk` rising edge so at first blush it seems hard to come up with the conclusion that `regfile.write_enable` must be set to 1 for just exactly one `clk` cycle and `0` otherwise. 
> 
> For instance, `ADD(R1, R2, R3)` will repeatedly write the content of `R1` + `R2` and store it at R3, and `ST(R5, destination, R31)` will repeatedly store the content of `R5` to `Mem[destination]`. The value in `R3` for the `ADD` instruction will remain the same even though we execute this instruction many times. The same works for the `ST` instruction. 
> 
> However, if we read-and-modify the same memory region in the same clock cycle as we do with the Regfile: `ADD(R0, R0, R0)`, or `MULC(R0, 3, R0)`, then we need to strictly run this instruction exactly <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">once</span>. Notice that only arithmetic `OP` and `OPC` will suffer from this bug. This bug is not possible in `ST/LD/LDR` because we can't `ST` to and `LD` from the same memory region in the same cycle.


Finally, when `slowclk` turns `1` (rising edge), `PC` is set to advance <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">in the next FPGA clock cycle</span>. In this current cycle (the `clk` cycle when `slowclk` just had its rising edge), we are still executing the <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">current</span> instruction. This is when we <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">capture</span> the computed arithmetic output from the current instruction into the REGFILE.  




## Sample Run

This section illustrates what should be observed on your FPGA IO Shield. When you compile the program above and flash it to your FPGA for the first time with **all** of its dip switches down, you will see the following as the first 16 bit of your instruction:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-41-10.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

This corresponds to `BR(reset): 0x77FF0019`. Pressing the `next` button (`io_button[4]`) will bring you to address `0x068` which is the `reset` handler, having the same MSB 16 bit of the `id`: `0x77FF`.

{: .note}
We assume you know which dip switch to set to view these states: `ia`, `id`, etc. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-41-10.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

The first line of instruction in the `reset` handler is `ADDC(R31, 12, R5): 0xC0BF000C`: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-43-35.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Press `next` one more time and confirm you're met with the `JMP(R5)` instruction (the MSB 16):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-44-42.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

At this point, the content of `Reg[R5]` is address `0x00C`. Pressing `next` will bring your PC to point to this address with instruction `ADDC(R31, 3, R1): 0xC03F0003`.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-46-06.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-46-34.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Continuously press `next` until you reach address `0x020`, the `BNE(R3, main_sub, R31)` instruction:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-47-01.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

At this point, the content of `R3` is 2, which means that you will be looped back to `main_sub` (adress `0x010`). Press `next` to confirm the content of PC is indeed `0x010`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-48-05.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

### Triggering `ILLOP`

The content of `R3` will be reduced by 1 in each loop to `main_sub`, until eventually its content is `0`. This will cause `BNE(R3, main_sub, R31)` to not branch, and the PC will execute instruction at address `0x024` instead:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-49-45.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

The instruction at address `0x024` is `LONG(256)`, which is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not a valid Beta instruction</span>. Executing this will trigger an `ILLOP`. When you press `next`, you will be brought to address `0x004` which contains instruction `BR(illop)`. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-50-52.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

{: .important}
Note that at this point, the MSB of the PC (we also call this `PC31`) is 1, which means that the CPU is supposedly at the **kernel mode**. This is also known as the <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">supervisor bit</span>

You can set `io_dip[0]: 0xD` to confirm:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-35-49.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>


### The `ILLOP` handler

The `illop_handler` resides at address `0x80000038` to address `0x8000064`, but for the ease of explanation, we simply report the last 3 hex digits. Surely enough when you press `next`, the PC will point to address `0x038`, which is the beginning of the `illop_handler`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-52-06.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

The ILLOP handler does a very simple thing, which is simply storing the value `5, 4, 3, 2, 1` to a particular memory address `message`.

{: .note}
`message` is set to be `0xC` in our FPGA, which is a shared-memory region to showcase our "output" to the `system_output_buffer`. 

```nasm
|| ILLOP HANDLER, KERNEL PROGRAM ||
illop: ADDC(R31, 5, R4)	|| countdown: 5,4,3,2,1 to mimmick illop handling
ST(R4, message, R31)
ADDC(R31, 4, R4) 
ST(R4, message, R31)
ADDC(R31, 3, R4) 
ST(R4, message, R31)
ADDC(R31, 2, R4) 
ST(R4, message, R31)
ADDC(R31, 1, R4) 
ST(R4, message, R31)
ADDC(R31, 12, R5)
JMP(R5)			|| jump to execute main program in user mode
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
```

Advance to address `0x040`. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-57-00.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Then set `io_dip[0] = 0xF` to view the content of `system_output_buffer`. You shall see the value `5` there. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-16-17-57-09.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

{: .note}
To witness it going from `5` to `4, 3, 2, 1`, simply switch up `io_dip[2][7]`. This triggers the `auto` execution mode with the **slow** clock. If you are impatient, you can switch up `io_dip[2][6]` as well and it will advance the PC at a faster rate. 

### Returning to `main` (user mode program)

Once we reach address `0x064`, we are met with the instruction `JMP(R5)`. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-37-26.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-39-16.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

At this point, the content of `R5` is `12` or `0xC`, which means that it should execute address `0xC` later in **user mode**. If you press `next`, you will meet the instruction `ADDC(R31, 3, R1)` again (`main`):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-40-52.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Surely enough, we are back at **user mode**. You can confirm this by inspecting the MSB of the `PC`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-41-24.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

### Receive user input 

You can press any button: `io_button[2:0]`. These are **hardwired** as user input, kinda how keyboards are connected to your PC by default. 

Firstly, let's confirm that your button presses are registered in `system_input_buffer`. This is just a `dff` situated at your `motherboard` to store current button presses, and it is **hardwired** to always be synced to `Mem[0x10]`. 

Assume that you are currently in **user mode**,  (that is your `ia31` or equivalently `pc31` is 0). Set your beta to **manual** mode (all `io_dip[2]` is down). For example, let's assume that we are currently pointing to address `0x14`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-59-26.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Press the top button (`io_button[0]`) and set `io_dip[0]: 0xE`. You should see `b0` shown in the 7 seg immediately: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-47-01.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

You can also press `io_button[0]` or `io_button[1]`, and a different output is shown at the 7seg:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-47-56.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-48-07.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

There's nothing fancy at this moment. You're simply viewing the content of `system_input_buffer` that stores current button presses **immediately**.

### The `irq` handler
What's interesting now is that if you press `next`, your `ia` (PC) will not execute the next address e.g (`0x10 SUBC`) but rather the <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">`irq` handler entry</span> at address `0x80000008`. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-51-46.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Address `0x80000008` contains instruction `BR(irq)` where `irq` is at address `0x80000028`, so pressing `next` will bring you there:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-52-27.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Let's study what's happening in the `irq` handler:

```nasm
|| IRQ HANDLER, KERNEL PROGRAM ||
irq: LD(R31, 16, R4)	|| load hardwired value at input_buffer (Mem[16])
ST(R4, message, R31)	|| store (display) input value at output_buffer (Mem[12])
ADDC(R31, 12, R5)	
JMP(R5)			|| jump to execute main program in user mode
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
```

At first, we **load** the content of `Mem[0x10]` to `Reg[R4]`. Remember that `system_input_buffer` is memory mapped to `Mem[0x10]` so what we are doing here is none other than loading the user input data to `Reg[R4]`. `system_input_buffer` should contain either `0xb0, 0xb1, or 0xb2` depending on which button you pressed. 

Then we store the content of `R4` to `Mem[0xC]`. Remember that `system_output_buffer` (which is equivalent to our monitors) is memory mapped to `Mem[0xC]` so our CPU can essentially store anything in this address `0xC` to "output" whatever we want so that it can be **seen** by the output device. 

View it at this moment and confirm that its value is `0x01` due to the previous countdown `5, 4, 3, 2, 1` from triggering the `illop` handler:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-08-54.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Now, advance two more instructions until your current instruction address is `0x80000030`. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-57-40.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Then, view the state of `system_output_buffer` by setting `io_dip[0]: 0xF`. You should see the encoding of your last pressed button there:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-09-58-13.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

### Returning to `main` program in User Mode
The last two instructions of the `irq` handler ensures that we `JMP` back to address `0xC`, which essentially **restarts** the `main` program. 

You can prove this easily by advancing to address `0x034` (the last instruction of `irq` handler):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-01-25.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Confirm that it is indeed `JMP(R5)`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-01-42.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Then press `next` and it should bring you back to address `0xC`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-01-59.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Again, realise that you will be back at **user mode** by this point by viewing `ia31` (set `io_dip[0]: 0xD`).

{: .warning-title}
> Problematic Return
>
> Did you realise that initially we were about to execute address `0x14` in **user mode** (main program), before the program got interrupted due to us pressing the input buttons, and yet we <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">do not resume</span> from `0x14`? We would expect our program to **resume** where it left off in the presence of hardware interrupt right? 


If our programs don't resume where it left off in the presence of (asynchronous) hardware interrupt, then our computers are not usable anymore. Imagine having our programs restart all the time at the event of any keyboard input or mouse movement or click. 

{: .new-title}
> The Solution 
>
> To know where to **return** to when user program is interrupted, we would save `PC+4` value (that is address `0x18` in our example because PC was pointing to `0x14` when the program is interrupted) in `Reg[XP]` (`R30`). This is why we call `R30` a **special register** as its purpose is solely to store the **return address** of the last "paused" or interrupted instruction. You have used it a lot as well in Week 9 when you learn Stack and Procedure because it is used to store the **return** address after a function call exits. 


### Interrupt in Kernel Mode

Our Beta CPU should **disable** interrupt when we are **currently** handling an event (be it handling `illop`, or `reset` or another `irq`). 

This is handled by the `irq_sampler` at the control unit:

```verilog
    // sample interrupt at the beginning of each cycle
    if (~irq_sampler.q){
      // sample only when interrupt bit is 0 (clear) 
      irq_sampler.d = irq;
    }
```

Plus the `irq` logic at the control unit:

```verilog
    if (irq_sampler.q & slowclk & ~ia31){
      pcsel = b100;
      wasel = 1;
      werf = 1;
      wdsel = b00;
      wr = 0;
      // clear interrupt bit 
      irq_sampler.d = 0;
    }
```

We check that `irq` cannot fire **when** `ia31 == 1`. However we do not "lose" the interrupt signal. `irq_sampler` dff was <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> reset to be `0` because the **only** way to clear it is by **handling** it. 

We can demonstrate this very easily. Simply advance your Beta until you enter the `illop` handler. For the purpose of this example, we advance our `PC` until it points to address `0x8000003C` (second instruction in `illop` handler). Ensure that your Beta CPU is in **manual** mode. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-17-22.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Then press `io_button[1]`. Ensure that this is immediately reflected at `system_input_buffer`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-18-02.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

Then press `next`. Notice that the next address of instruction to be executed is `0x80000040` and <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">not</span> the `irq` hander (`0x80000008`). 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-19-06.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

The entire `illop` handler will be executed up until the last instruction at address `0x064`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-20-53.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

This will result in the Beta CPU returning to the **user mode** and its `PC` pointing to address `0x0C`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-21-15.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>


However, now our `irq` will take place. By pressing `next`, we are brought to the **entry** of the `irq` handler instead of the next address `0x10`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-22-06.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

At this point, you will execute the entire sequence of `irq` handler and observe `00b1` at `system_output_buffer` eventually. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//assets/images/lab4-part2/2023-03-17-10-23-23.png"  class="center_fifty no-invert"/>

{: .note}
This short activity demonstrates that asynchronous interrupt (due to user input) is not necessarily "lost" even though we are in the midst of executing a program in Kernel mode (handling another event like `illop`). Of course, only the **last** input (before its handled) is captured because our `system_input_buffer` can only capture the last input. If we spam press the buttons while our Beta is running **very slowly** handling `illop` in Kernel mode, then earlier button presses will be *lost* and we only handle the final button press to be displayed at `system_output_buffer`. 

In practice, this is tackled in three ways:
1. Our CPU clock is **extremely fast** (>3 Ghz in 2023) such that it is humanly impossible to spam user inputs that fast. Our previous user input would have been **processed** by the `irq` handler before we can even supply another one. 
2. Our Operating System Kernel will assign interrupt **priority**, so in practice we **can** interrupt our system in Kernel mode (provided contingency plans are in place so that we don't lose our existing task). We will learn more about this at the end of this course and also in the first few weeks of 50.005. 
3. There exist smarter microcontrollers on our motherboard, and not just a simple `system_input_buffer` like what we have in this lab. They are capable of storing quite a bit of information and **wait** until our CPU is free to handle the interrupt event. 


You need not to worry about the possibility that asynchronous interrupt request is *lost* at this point. Just now that *eventually*, all interrupt requests should be handled by our Operating System Kernel (which means you need to use a good kernel program coupled with decent hardware).

## Summary

Experiment with different assembly program of your liking to ensure that you understand how Beta CPU works. You can even execute functions with proper procedure, or even use this as your 1D project. 

{: .important}
Please talk to your instructors if you plan to implement your 1D with a general purpose CPU instead of an FSM. We would like to learn more about your implementation beforehand.

Also, be mindful about the <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">supervisor bit</span>. Ensure that you fully understand how it can be set or cleared. We paste the information from the first part of the handout below for clarity. 

The highest-order bit of the PC (`PC31`/`ia31`) is dedicated as the **supervisor** bit (see section 6.3 of the [**Beta Documentation**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L4TXMEDgD5gTN2JSd4ea_APpwNKUpzqK/view?usp=share_link)). 
* The `LDR` instruction **ignores** this bit, treating it as if it were *zero*. 
* The `JMP` instruction is allowed to clear the Supervisor bit or leave it unchanged, but <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">cannot set</span> it, 
* **No other instructions may have any effect on `PC31`**

The Beta CPU implemented in this lab is simplistic. We don't have fancy stuffs as follows that provides abstraction and improves efficiency:
1. Operating System Kernel 
2. Fancy I/O (keyboard, mouse)
3. Virtual Address and Cache 

However, hopefully this has shed some light to give you clarity on how our computers work and how they are constantly improved so that it can be the general-purpose devices we love today.
