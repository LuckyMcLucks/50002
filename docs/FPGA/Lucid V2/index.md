# Lucid V2 
{: .no_toc}

You can find FPGA tutorials using Lucid V2 in the sidebar. If you find any bugs, please make a PR or report it to your instructor.

If you're familiar with Lucid V1, Lucid V2 comes with a few breaking changes (although they are 90% similar and shouldn't be too difficult to get used to). Read [this](https://alchitry.com/news/lucid-1-vs-2/) post to find out more about the breaking changes.
