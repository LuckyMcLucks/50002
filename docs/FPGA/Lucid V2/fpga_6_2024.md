## **Driving WS2812B LEDs with an FPGA**  

### Driver Code 

You can download the driver code from [here](https://github.com/natalieagus/ws2812b-v2/blob/main/source/ws2812b_driver.luc). 

### **Overview**
WS2812B LEDs are **individually addressable RGB LEDs** with an integrated driver chip. They use a **single-wire protocol** to receive data and control color. Since each LED in a strip or matrix can store its own color information, a long sequence of LEDs can be controlled with just **one data pin**.

### Connection

Connect Din directly to FPGA GPIO Pin, GND to FPGA GND, and +5V to FPGA +5V Ports. If you use external power, ensure that GND is shared between the FPGA and WS2812B.
 
In the sample code above, you should connect Din to **pin C40** as defined in the constraint file:

### **How WS2812B Works**
- Each LED contains **a red, green, and blue LED** with **8-bit brightness control** (0–255).
- Data is sent **serially** in **24-bit GRB format**:
  - **8 bits for Green**
  - **8 bits for Red**
  - **8 bits for Blue**
- The LEDs **store** the data and pass the remaining data down the strip.
- A **reset signal** (low for >50 µs) tells the LEDs to update their colors.

### **Communication Protocol**

WS2812B uses a **pulse-width encoding scheme** to differentiate between `1` and `0`:

| Bit Value | High Time | Low Time | Total Period |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **0**     | 0.4 µs   | 0.85 µs  | 1.25 µs     |
| **1**     | 0.8 µs   | 0.45 µs  | 1.25 µs     |

- The **timing must be precise**, requiring accurate pulse generation from the FPGA.

For a 100MHz clock, we have: 

| Bit Value | High Time | Low Time | Total Period | High Cycles (100 MHz) | Low Cycles (100 MHz) | Total Cycles |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| **0**     | 0.4 µs   | 0.85 µs  | 1.25 µs     | **40 cycles**         | **85 cycles**         | **125 cycles** |
| **1**     | 0.8 µs   | 0.45 µs  | 1.25 µs     | **80 cycles**         | **45 cycles**         | **125 cycles** |
| **RESET** | **Low for >50 µs** | | | | **5000 cycles** (minimum) |

**Explanation**: 
- **Each WS2812B bit takes 1.25 µs = 125 cycles at 100 MHz.**
- A **logic ‘0’**:
  - High for **40 cycles** (0.4 µs)
  - Low for **85 cycles** (0.85 µs)
- A **logic ‘1’**:
  - High for **80 cycles** (0.8 µs)
  - Low for **45 cycles** (0.45 µs)
- **Reset signal**:
  - Hold data line **low for at least 50 µs** (5000 cycles at 100 MHz).

{:.important}
Adjust the values above accordingly for other clock frequencies. 

### **Sending Data to WS2812B**
1. **Send a 24-bit color value for each LED** in the GRB format.
2. **Ensure correct timing** of `1` and `0` bits using precise pulse widths.
3. **Send a reset signal** (low for >50 µs) after **all** LEDs have received their data.


### Implementation

The driver implementation can be found in the file `ws2812b_driver.luc`. 

## Demo Code 

The demo project utilising the driver can be found [here](https://github.com/natalieagus/ws2812b-v2.git).  Consult its readme on how to operate it.
