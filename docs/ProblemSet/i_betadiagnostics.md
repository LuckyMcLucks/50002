# Beta CPU Diagnostics
{: .no_toc}


Each topic's questions are grouped into **three** categories: basic, intermediate, and challenging. You are recommended to do all basic problem set before advancing further. 

{: .important}
Before you proceed, we suggest you explore the `bsim` and [**read** the beta documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L4TXMEDgD5gTN2JSd4ea_APpwNKUpzqK/view?usp=share_link) given in the course handout, especially this section called **Convenience Macros** that makes it easier to express certain common operations.

## Beta Instruction Replacements (Intermediate)

For each of the statements below, indicate whether they're True or False and provide your reasoning. 

* **Statement 1:**  In the Beta, every `ADDC` instruction can **always** be replaced by a `SUBC` instruction that puts precisely the **same** value in the destination register. For example, `ADDC(R0,1,R0)` is equal to `SUBC(R0,-1,R0)` (*think about all constants*).  
* **Statement 2:** In a Beta program, you can use `BEQ(R31, label, R31)` as a substitute for `JMP(Ra)` where `Ra` stores the address of `label`, no matter where `label` is. 
* **Statement 3:** We can never perform `LD` and `ST`  to any two independent addresses in a *single cycle* (even if the memory unit supports it) by just modifying the **control unit** of the Beta. In other words, we need to modify the datapath of the Beta in order to do this. 

<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
<strong>Statement 1 is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">False</span></strong>. We can have <code>ADDC(R0, -32768, R0)</code> but we cant have <code>SUBC(R0, 32768, R0)</code> as the most positive number that a signed 16-bit can represent is <code>32767</code>.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Statement 2 is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">False</span></strong>. <code>Ra</code> contains 32-bit of data, so we can set <code>PC</code> to be pointing to <i>any</i> address in the memory (4GB of address space) with <code>JMP(Ra)</code>. However, <code>BEQ</code> only covers <code>32768 times 4</code> (above <code>PC+4</code>) + <code>32768 times 4</code> (*below and inclusive of <code>PC+4</code>*) bytes of address space.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Statement 3 is True</strong>. The output of the <code>ALU</code> supplies a <strong>single</strong> address for both load and store to the memory unit. </p></div><br>

## PCSEL Fault Detection (Intermediate)

This time round, consider a Beta machine with a faulty **control unit**, where its `PCSEL` signal is always `0`, meaning that the input to the `PC` register is always  `PC+4` *regardless* of the instruction.

As always, we can  detect this particular fault by running a simple test program written in Beta assembly language. State which of the following programs can **detect** this particular fault, meaning that if it was to be run on a faulty Beta machine, we will get different results (contents) on the registers in the regfiles, PC, or Memory Unit, and provide your reasoning. 

Assume that all register values were `0` at the beginning of each program execution.

**Program 1**: (executed for two CLK cycles)
```nasm
.= 0  
BEQ(R0, .+4, R31)  
ADDC(R0, 1, R0)  
```

**Program 2**: (executed for three CLK cycles)
```nasm
.=0  
CMPEQ(R0, R0, R0)  
BNE(R0, .-4, R31)  
ADDC(R0, 1, R0)
```

**Program 3**: (executed for four CLK cycles)
```nasm
.=0  
LD(R0, 0, R0)  
MULC(R0, 1, R0)  
BNE(R0, .+4, R31)  
CMPEQ(R0, R31, R2)
```

**Program 4**: (executed for two CLK cycles)
```nasm
.=0
ST(R0, x, R31) 
x: LONG(12)
```

**Program 5**: (executed for two CLK cycles)
```nasm
.=0  
JMP(R1)  
ADDC(R0, 1, R1)
```

**Program 6**: (executed for two CLK cycles)
```nasm
.=0  
LDR(.+8, R0)  
ADDC(R0, 1, R1)  
x : LONG(3)
```



<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
Program 2, 4, and 5 can successfully <strong>detect</strong> this faulty. All of them forces the control unit to produce non-zero <code>PCSEL</code>. For example, <strong>Program 4</strong> results in <code>illop</code> when the Beta attempts to execute <code>LONG(12)</code> because it isn't an instruction. Therefore <code>PCSEL=3</code> if the control unit works properly and that the content of <code>PC</code> will be <code>ILLOP</code> (wherever the address of illegal operation handler is) instead of address <code>0xC</code>. </p></div><br>


## Quality Control (Intermediate)
One Beta manufacturer is having quality-control problems with their design. In particular, they've had reliability issues with various device connections that are circled in the diagram below.

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/i71imaa2toxsnk7/betafault.png?raw=1" class="center_seventy"  >

Your job is to **write some test programs** to help determine if a machine is fault-free. Assume that when a device connection is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">faulty</span>, the indicated **bus or signal** is always **producing** `0` instead of the *expected value*.

**For each** of the circled connections, **write an instruction sequence** that when executed for a **specified number of cycles** will leave the following result in `R0`: 
*  `1` in `R0` if the connection was working.
* Other values in `R0` if the connection was faulty. 

{: .note}
You can assume that all registers are reliably set to 0 before each sequence is executed. There's many possible answers, they aren't unique.

Give your instruction sequence for each of the six indicated faults and briefly **explain** how each sequence detects the fault and produces something besides `1` in `R0` when the fault is present:
* **Fault A:** Input 1 of `PCSEL` mux has a value of `0` instead of `PC+4+4*SEXT(C)`.
* **Fault B:** `RA2SEL` multiplexer control signal is `0` instead of as per intended current instruction `OPCODE`.
* **Fault C:** `Z` input to control logic is always `0` instead of the correct value depending on `RD1`.
* **Fault D:**   `BSEL` multiplexer control signal `0`  instead of as per intended current instruction `OPCODE`.
* **Fault E:** `WR` memory control signal is `0`  instead of as per intended current instruction `OPCODE`.
* **Fault F:** Input 0 of `WDSEL` mux has a value of `0` instead of `PC+4`.




**Fault A:** Input 1 of `PCSEL` mux has a value of `0` instead of `PC+4+4*SEXT(C)`.

## A Confused Beta CPU (Hard)

When Alice was walking back to her hostel this morning, she dropped her Beta CPU and it hit the ground pretty hard. She suspected that these components do not work properly anymore:


* **Fault 1**: Input 2 of `PCSEL` mux (the `JT` input) is always `0` instead of the usual `Reg[Ra]`
* **Fault 2**: `WR` memory control signal is always `1` instead of as per intended current intended instruction `OPCODE` (always writing to memory)
* **Fault 3**: Input `0` of `BSEL` mux is faulty, it always read `0x00000000` instead of the actual 32-bit register data value produced by the second data port of the REGFILE unit. (Note: REGFILE unit is NOT faulty).

She quickly wrote a diagnostic program that hopefully can detect all these faults at once. Her program is as follows, starting from address 0. 

```nasm
ADDC(R31, 16, R0)   | 0
ADD(R31, R0, R0)    | 4
LD(R31, 16, R1)     | 8
ADDC(R31, 28, R0)   | 12
JMP(R0)             | 16
SUBC(R31, 1, R1)    | 20
SUBC(R31, 1, R2)    | 24

label: ADDC(R31, 7, R3) | 28

HALT()              | 32
```

She sets the program to run for **6** cycles (to complete all 6), and then inspect the content of PC Register, Memory, and all registers in the REGFILE. You shall assume that:
* In the beginning, the content of all registers in the REGFILE is `0`, and
* If any ILLEGAL operation is executed (illegal `OPCODE`), then the program will **stop** its execution immediately (even if 6 completed cycles are not met yet), and 
* Muxes that are **not** involved in the current operation will always have its selector bit set as `0`, e.g: if we don't use `RA2SEL` mux during a particular operation, the CU always set `RA2SEL` signal to `0`. 
* Instruction and Data memory lives in the **same address space** (they're not separate!). This makes **Fault 2** very dangerous. 

State whether each statement below is True or False and provide your reasoning. 

**Statement 1**: If Fault 1 exists, but Fault 2 and 3 does NOT exist, then `Reg[R3]` will always contain the decimal value `0` instead of `7`. 
<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
**True**. `R3` is only modified if the instruction at line 28 is executed.<br><br>
The content of `R0` is 28 the moment the `ADDC` instruction at address 12 is executed. However at address 16, we will always `JMP` to address `0` instead of 28 due to Fault 1. Our program will always loop between address 0 to 16 (if allowed to run forever) and will never reach instruction at address `28` which modifies `R3`. 
</p></div><br>

**Statement 2**: If Fault 1 does **not** exist AND  Fault 3 does **not** exist, then the content of `Reg[R3]` is `7` (in decimal value). 
<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
**False**. In other words: only Fault 2 exists. We need to pay attention to the output of the ALU (which dictates `EA`) and the output of `RD2` port of the REGFILE (which dictates memory write data `mwd`) at each instruction execution. When the third instruction (`LD(R31, 16, R1)`) is executed, the side effect due to fault 2 is that we are **storing** the content of `R0` (which is currently `16`) to address `16`. 
<br><br>
This is because the output of the ALU is `16`, and the output of `RD2` port is the content of `R0` (as current `inst[15:11]`, which is our `Rb` is `00000`). That means the instruction `JMP(R0)` is now **overwritten** to be `0x00000010` (or 16 in decimal) after the this instruction is executed. When the `PC` reaches address 16, it will trigger an `ILLOP` instead and we will never have the chance to reach `label` and modify the content of `Reg[R3]`.
</p></div><br>

**Statement 3**: If Fault 2 exists, then Alice won't be able to tell whether Fault 1 exists or not.
<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
**True**. The `JMP` instruction is the only one that can test whether Fault 1 exists or not.  As explained in (2) above, our `JMP` instruction is overwritten the moment we execute the third instruction (`LD` at address 8). Hence, we won't have a chance to confirm and isolate the existence of Fault 1 if Fault 2 exists at the same time.
</p></div><br>

**Statement 4:** If Fault 2 exists, then `Reg[R1]` will contain the value of decimal `16` **regardless** of whether Fault 1 and/or Fault 3 exist or not.
<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
**True**. Fault 3 only affects Type 1 instructions, while Fault 1 only affects `JMP`. When the first instruction (`ADDC(R31, 16, R0)`) is executed, the side effect is that we are storing the content of `R0` (as current `inst[15:11]` is `00000`) which is currently `0` to `Mem[16]`. When the second instruction is executed (`ADD(R31, R0, R0)`), we might have either `0` or `16` that's eventually stored at `R0` (depending on whether Fault 3 exists or not). Thus, the output of the ALU may be `0` or `16`, and the output of RD2 is still `Reg[R0]`, which means that the current content of `Mem[16]` is unchanged due to Fault 2.<br><br>
The next instruction, `LD(R31, 16, R1)` produces `16` as the output of the ALU, and `Reg[R0]` again at `RD2`, leaving `Mem[16]` unchanged. The next instruction at address 12: `ADDC(R31, 28, R0)` changes `Mem[28]` instead to the content of `R0`. The CPU will then meet an `ILLOP` as it tries to execute the instruction at address `16`, leaving the content of `Mem[16]` to still be `16`. 
</p></div><br>

**Statement 5:** Alice will be able to tell with **certainty** that none of the fault exists if `Reg[R3]` contains the decimal value `7`, **and** the `Reg[R0]` contains the decimal value `28` **and** the memory content between address 0 and 32 contains all original instructions stated above at the end of 6 successful cycles of execution.
<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
**False**. Alice won't be able to tell if Fault 3 exists at all. Fault 3 only affects Type 1 instructions, such as `ADD(R31, R0, R0)`, and then inspect the content of `R0` the moment this instruction is executed. If Fault 3 exists, then `Reg[R0]` will be `0` instead of `16`. However, since she will only inspect the Regs and the Memory after 6 CPU cycles, the content of `Reg[R0]` would've been overwritten by instruction at address `12` (`ADDC(R31, 28, R0)`), resulting in `28` at `R0`.  Since `ADDC` is **not** affected by Fault 3 and it overwrites the possible side effect of Fault 3, Alice's proposed program is flawed and won't be able to diagnose with certainty that all 3 faults do **not** exist. 
</p></div><br>

**Statement 6:** If Fault 2 does NOT exist, then Reg[R1] will contain the value 0x6FE00000 regardless of whether Fault 1 or Fault 3 exists or not.
<div cursor="pointer" class="collapsible">Show Answer</div><div class="content_answer"><p>
**True**. The `SUBC` instruction that modifies `Reg[R1]` will **not** ever be executed regardless of whether any faults exist or not (the `JMP` instruction prevents it from being executed, and if we overwrite the `JMP` instruction due to Fault 2, `ILLOP` will be triggered). Hence, the only instruction that can modify `Reg[R1]` is `LD(R31, 16, R1)`. None of the faults directly affect the ability of the CPU to execute this instruction, so we will always be able to set `Reg[R1] <-- Mem[16]`.<br><br>
If Fault 2 does not exist, then we will **not** accidentally alter the memory's content, and `Mem[16]` will still contain the instruction `JMP(R0)`. When translated to machine language, `JMP(R0) = 0x6FE00000`.
