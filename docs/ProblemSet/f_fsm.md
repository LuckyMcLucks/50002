# State Machine
{: .no_toc}

Each topic's questions are grouped into **three** categories: basic, intermediate, and challenging. You are recommended to do all basic problem set before advancing further. 
## Classifying FSM (Basic)
The diagram below illustrates the FSM diagram of a machine that has the same purpose. The circle that is bolded signifies the starting state. 

State whether the following is *true or false* and explain your answer:
* **Statement 1:** "Diagram A illustrates a Mealy machine."
* **Statement 2:** "Diagram B can be further minimized."

What is the *purpose* of these FSMs?

<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
<p>
<strong>Statement 1</strong> is <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">false</span> because the machine in Diagram A has its output that depends only on its state. <strong>Statement 2</strong> is **true**, we can minimise it into just two states because <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> are <strong>equivalent</strong>. 
<br><br>
The purpose of both machines is to detect the presence of an edge and output a <code>1</code> <strong>once</strong> for the cycle where the edge happens, and <code>0</code> otherwise.
</p>
</div><br>

Your friend plot the timing diagram of the machine in Diagram A and obtain the following output:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/cws3uke3gekty4k/plotfsm.png?raw=1"  class="center_fifty">

Assume that the machine starts at `S0`. While referring to the FSM diagram up above, write the current state that occurs at instances `[A], [B], [C],` and `[D]` respectively. 


<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
<p>
We can obtain the answers  easily by running the FSM step by step. At each labeled instance, the machine is at the following states:
<br>
<ul>  
<li><code>[A]: S0</code>,</li>  
<li><code>[B]: S2</code>,</li>  
<li><code>[C]: S1</code>,</li>  
<li><code>[D]: S0</code>,</li>  
</ul></p></div>

## An Incomplete State Machine (Basic)
The ACME Company has recently received an order from a Mr. Wiley E. Coyote for their all-digital Perfectly Perplexing Padlock (P3):
* The P3 has **two** buttons ("0" and "1") that when pressed cause the FSM controlling the lock to advance to a new state. 
* In addition to advancing the FSM, each button press is encoded on the B signal (B=0 for button "0", B=1 for button "1"). 
* The padlock **unlocks** when the FSM sets the UNLOCK output signal to 1, which it does whenever the last N button presses correspond to the unique N-digit combination.
* The FSM should **not** fully reset if a valid prefix (1 bit) of the sequence is still present, so after an incorrect input, **check if the last entered digit matches the beginning of the correct sequence**.

  
Unfortunately the design notes for the P3 are *incomplete*. Using the specification above and clues gleaned from the partially completed diagrams below **fill in the information that is missing from the state transition diagram** with its **accompanying truth table**. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/ProblemSet/images/f_fsm/2025-02-19-11-25-26.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

When done,
*  Each state in the transition diagram should be assigned a 2-bit state name `S1 S0` (note that in this design the state name is not derived from the combination that opens the lock),
*  The arcs leaving each state should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive,
*  The value for UNLOCK should be specified for each state, and the truth table should be completed.

Also, **what** is the **combination** of the lock? 

<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
<p>
This state machine is a <strong>Moore machine</strong>. The completed state transition diagram and truth table is as follows:
<br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}//docs/ProblemSet/images/f_fsm/2025-02-19-11-28-24.png"  class="center_seventy"/>
<br>
The combination for the lock is <code>010</code>.
</p></div>

## Constructing an FSM (Basic)

Construct a **divisible-by-3** **Moore** FSM that accepts a binary number entered **one** bit at a time. The most significant bit entered first, and the FSM should indicate with an output light (1 bit) if the number entered so far is divisible by 3. 

{: .new-title}
> Hint
> 
> The FSM has 3 states.


Answer the following questions:

1.  Draw a state transition diagram for your FSM indicating the initial state and for which states the light should be turned on. 
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>

	If the **value** of the number entered so far is `N`, then if digit `b` is entered next, the value of the new number `N'` is `2N + b`. Using this fact:
	<ul>
	<li>  If `N mod 3 == 0` then for some integer `p`,` N = 3p + 0`. After the digit b is entered, `N' = 6p + b`. So `N'` is `b mod 3`.</li>
	<li>  If `N mod 3 == 1` then for some integer `p`, `N = 3p + 1`. After the digit b is entered, `N' = 6p + 2 + b`. So `N'` is `b+2 mod 3`.</li>
	<li>  If `N mod 3 == 2` then for some integer `p`, `N = 3p + 2`. After the digit b is entered, `N' = 6p + 4 + b`. So `N'` is `b+1 mod 3`.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>This leads to the following transition diagram where each state corresponds to each of the possible values of `N mod 3`.

	<br>
	</p></div>

2. Construct a truth table for the FSM logic. Inputs include the state bits and the next bit of the number; outputs include the next state bits and the control for the light. Remember that this should be a Moore machine, so the output (light) should follow the **current** state output and not the next state.

	S_1 & S_0 & b & S_1' & S_0' & \text{light} \\
	\hline

	 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\

	 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	\hline
	\end{matrix}
	$$
	</p>
	</div><br>

3. Write down the boolean equation for the FSM.

	<p>

	The boolean equation for the FSM is:
	$$
	\begin{aligned}
	\text{light } &= \overline{S_1} \cdot \overline{S_0}\\
	S_1' &= \overline{S_1} \cdot S_0 \cdot \overline{b} + S_1 \cdot \overline{S_0} \cdot b \\
	S_0' &= \overline{S_1} \cdot \overline{S_0} \cdot b + S_1 \cdot \overline{S_0} \cdot \overline{b}\\
	\end{aligned}
	$$

[Video explanation here.](https://youtu.be/WbhtWbL45jw) 

Let's analyse the circuit by answering the questions below:
1. If the circuit has an **initial** state of `AB=00`, and the input at `t=0` is `x=0`, what will the immediate next state be?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The immediate next state is: <code>AB = 00</code>. You can easily trace this output from the circuit above. 
	</p>
	</div><br>
	
2. If the circuit has an **initial** state of `AB=00`, and the input at `t=0` is `x=1`, what will the immediate next state be?	
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The immediate next state is: <code>AB = 01</code>. You can easily trace this output from the circuit above. 
	</p>
	</div><br>

3. If the circuit has a **current** state `AB=01`, and the current input is  `x=1`, what will the immediate next state be?	
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The immediate next state is: <code>AB = 10</code>. You can easily trace this output from the circuit above. 
	</p>
	</div><br>

4. If the circuit has a **current** state `AB=11`, and the current input is  `x=1`, what will the immediate next state be?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The immediate next state is: <code>AB = 11</code>. You can easily trace this output from the circuit above. 
	</p>
	</div><br>

5. If the circuit has a **current** state `AB=11`, and the current input is  `x=0`, what will the immediate next state be?	
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The immediate next state is: <code>AB = 00</code>. You can easily trace this output from the circuit above. 
	</p>
	</div><br>

6. What are the state(s) that can go to state `AB=00` as its ***next*** state?

	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	All combinations: <code>AB=00, 01, 10</code>, or <code>11</code>. You can prove it easily by brute force: checking if <code>AB = 00</code> next if its previously set to some value <code>AB = ij</code> given existing value <code>x</code>. 
	</p></div><br>

7. What is the value of output `y` when the current state is `AB = 11` and the current input is `x = 0`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	Tracing it out, we have <code>y=1</code>. 
	</p></div><br>

8. The propagation delays for all the combinational logic gates and the flip-flops are `2ns`. The clock frequency is `100MHz`. **What is the worst case delay** in nanosecond for the next states at `A` and `B` to appear (i.e. for `A` and `B` to be valid) after the input `x` is changed to be a valid input. *Assume that the initial states `AB` are given and fixed.*
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	From the frequency, we can compute the <i>period</i> of the clock to be <code>10ns</code>. 
	<br><br>
	For the <strong>worst</strong> case delay, we need to consider the scenario that input <code>x</code> is propagated up to input of the register and <i>it just missed the <code>clk</code> rise</i>. It takes <code>4ns</code> to propagate through the <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> gates, and another <code>10ns</code> to wait for another <code>clk</code> rise. Finally, it takes <code>2ns</code> to propagate through the register to produce <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>. Hence the <strong>worst case delay</strong> is <code>4+10+2 = 16ns</code>.
	</p></div><br>


9. The **propagation** delays for all the combinational logic gates and the flip-flops are `2ns`. Each `dff` have **th** and **ts** of `1ns` each.  If the clock frequency is not given, what is the **maximum clock frequency** *(smallest `clk` period)* that we can have for this device?

	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The clock period has to satisfy the <strong>feedback</strong> path (t2 timing constraint), that is made up with **tpd** of the <code>dff</code>,  **tpd** of the <code>AND</code> gate,  **tpd** of the <code>OR</code> gate, plus **ts** of the register. This adds up to <code>2+2+2+1 = 7ns</code>. Hence the maximum frequency is:$$\frac{1}{(7*10^{-9})}= 142.9MHz$$.
	</p>
	</div><br>

10. What are the output sequences from `t=0` to `t=15` of the circuit when fed the following input (fed from *left* to *right*): `1101 1111 1110 0010` from `t=0` to `t=15` respectively? Assume that the initial states are `AB=00`.
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	Given that the initial state is <code>AB=00</code>, that makes <code>B = 1</code> at <code>t=0</code>.  This is doable the tedious way by simply tracing the output <code>y</code> sixteen times from <code>t=0</code> to <code>t=15</code>. We can also deduce from the functionality of the device, that is to <strong>detect</strong> three consecutive <code>1</code>'s and output <code>0</code> afterwards. The output sequence is therefore <code>0000 0011 1111 0000</code> from <code>t=0</code> to <code>t=15</code>. repectively.
	</p></div>

## State-Machine Timing Computation (Intermediate)

Take a look at the following State Machine circuitry:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/d8o2nhv1ugouf2g/Q3.png?raw=1"  class="center_fifty">

The device `A2` has the following schematic:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/9e2jzfrwtjto34p/Q4.png?raw=1" class="center_thirty">

It is made out of this device we call `A000R` with **tcd** = `1ns`, and **tpd** = `3ns` with the following schematic:

<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/55rj88ehoozyo6y/Q5.png?raw=1" class="center_thirty">

The truth table for `A000R` is as follows: 

$$
\begin{matrix}
    A & B & C & D & E \\
    \hline 
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \hline
\end{matrix}
$$

The timing specifications for other devices in the state machine is:
*  The Mux has the following time specification: **tcd** = `1ns`, and **tpd** = `2ns`.
* The Registers has the following time specification: **tcd** = `2ns`, **tpd** = `5ns`, **ts** = `2ns`, **th** = `2ns`.

Both `A1` and `A2` are **combinational** logic that contains `A000R` only. Unfortunately, the design for `A1` is missing. We only know that `A1` uses only `A000R` to compute the output and the next state function and that `A1` has the same **tpd** as `A2`. The other information that we have is that the output of `A1`, `X[2:0]` is a sequence of decimal, `[1, 2, 3, ... ]` in the binary form, i.e. `[001, 010, 011, ...]`.

Answer the following questions:
1. How many bits should the constant `Z1` have?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	Since one of the inputs to the muxes are 3-bits, this hardware is implemented using three 2-input mux. <code>Z1</code> is essentially <strong>three bits</strong>, connected to <i>each</i> of the three copies of 2-input muxes.
	</p></div><br>

2. How many bits should the constant `Z2` have?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	<strong>1 bit</strong>. The number of bits of each input to a combinational logic device such as <code>A1</code> does not depend on anything else or other inputs.
	</p></div><br>

3. What is the decimal value of `Z1`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	Since <code>X[2:0]</code> produces an increasing sequence from decimal value of <code>1,2,3,4,...</code> etc, we can easily guess that the the decimal value of <code>Z1</code> should be <code>0</code>, such that when there's a <code>RESET</code>, the output of the register <code>R1</code> is zero.
	</p></div><br>

4. What is the decimal value of `Z2`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	<code>Z2</code>'s decimal value is <code>1</code>. The same reason applies: since the sequence <code>X[2:0]</code> produced by <code>A1</code> is increasing by 1, the input to <code>A1</code> should be 1 such that at *every* cycle, theres an addition of 1 to be produced at <code>X</code>.
	</p></div><br>

5. What is the **tpd** of `A2` in nanosecond?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The  **tpd**  of <code>A000R</code> is 3ns, hence the  **tpd**  of <code>A2</code> is <code>9ns</code> since it is made out of three <code>A000R</code> modules connected in series.
	</p></div><br>
	
6. What is the minimum clock period in nanosecond?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
		The longest path that the clock period has to satisfy is <code>R1 -> A1 -> A2 -> Z1 -> R2</code>. Hence we need to consider the **tpd** of all devices in its path (except <code>R2</code>) plus **ts** of <code>R2: 5+9+9+2+2 = 27ns</code>.
	</p></div><br>

7. What is the minimum **tcd** of `A1` in nanosecond such that **th** of input (`Z2`) can be 0?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	**tcd** of <code>A1</code> has to be large enough so as to satisfy  **th** of <code>R1</code>. **th** of <code>R1</code> is <code>2ns</code>, and  **tcd** of the mux is <code>1ns</code>. Therefore min **tcd** of <code>A1</code> is <code>2-1 = 1ns</code>.
	</p></div><br>

8. What is value of `A2`'s **tcd** in nanosecond?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	The **tcd** of <code>A2</code> is basically the **tcd** of a single <code>A000R (1ns)</code> since that is the <i>shortest</i> path from any input to any output in <code>A2</code>.
	</p></div><br>

9. When `RESET` is `1` for several cycles, what will be the value of `X[2:0]`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	When <code>RESET</code> is <code>1</code>, the output of <code>R1</code> will be <code>000</code>. Hence the value of <code>X[2:0]</code> will be <code>001</code>..
	</p></div><br>

10. When `X`'s output is sequences of value `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, what is the value of `RESET`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	<code>RESET</code> has to be <code>0</code> to enable the <i>addition</i> of the previous value of `X` to take effect, and form a new value of `X` in the next clock cycle.
	</p></div><br>

Now, suppose that at time `t=0`, `RESET` signal is changed from `1` to `0`, and `X` becomes `001`. From then on, `RESET` remains `0`:

1. What is the decimal value of `O[2:0]` at time `t = 0`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	 <code>X</code>  is  <code>001</code>  and  <code>Y</code>  is  <code>000</code>  at  <code>t=0</code>. Using the truth table of  <code>A000R</code> and the schematic of  <code>A1</code>, we can deduce that  <code>O[2:0]</code>at  <code>t=0</code> is  <code>1</code>.
	</p></div><br>

2. What is the decimal value of `O[2:0]` at time `t = 1`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	 <code>X</code>  is  <code>010</code>  and  <code>Y</code>  is  <code>001</code>  at  <code>t=1</code>. Using the truth table of  <code>A000R</code> and the schematic of  <code>A1</code>, we can deduce that  <code>O[2:0]</code>at  <code>t=1</code> is  <code>3</code>.
	</p></div><br>

3. What is the decimal value of `O[2:0]` at time `t = 3`?
	<div  cursor="pointer"  class="collapsible">Show Answer</div>  <div  class="content_answer">
	<p>
	 <code>X</code>  is  <code>011</code>  and  <code>Y</code>  is  <code>011</code>  at  <code>t=2</code>. Using the truth table of  <code>A000R</code> and the schematic of  <code>A2</code>, we can deduce that  <code>O[2:0]</code>at  <code>t=3</code> is  <code>2</code>.
	</p></div><br>





## FSM Possibility (Basic)


We saw that certain functions, such as parentheses checking, cannot be performed by any finite state machine. Which of the following can be performed by an FSM?
